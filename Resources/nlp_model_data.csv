0,0,0,Charges my bike computer very well.,"This pack of usb-c to usb-c cables is perfectly serviceable.  I have used them to charge my bicycle computer with no problems.  At the price, they work just fine.  My first impression is that the cable is sturdily made, the braided sheathing will likely offer good protection.  They are very flexible and do not seem to hold shape but are quite pliable.  The length is good, but I'm sure anyone reading this knows what length they need.

34,34,34,I Really Wanted to Like These,"I have always been one to ignore Beats headphones, but recently, I decided to try a pair of the Beats Studio Pros because they were on an irresistible sale. I was more impressed with them than I thought, even with some of their shortcomings.

Which is why I decided to give the new Solo 4s a try. For me, these simply didn't have enough for me to keep them in my collection, particularly given that I own the Studio Pros.

Recently, I have become a fan of on-ear headphones (as distinct from over-ear). I own the Skullcandy Riff 2, the Sony WH-CH520, and the JBL Live 670. The Solo 4s are the only ones I've returned. And it's not because they were so offensive or horrible; they simply didn't add anything to my collection.

First of all, the clamping force was inordinately tight for my head. Normally, this doesn't bother me. But these simply were too uncomfortable from the moment I put them on, and they only got worse the longer I wore them.

Then there was the sound. Like I said, I own the Beats Studio Pros, and have an appreciation for what they are and what they do. Even though they don't have the ability to be EQed, which I prefer, I like them in and of themselves and enjoy the sound they provide. The Solo 4s are similar in that they are a what-you-get-is-what-you-get sound. In this case, however, I found myself wishing for an equalizer. They sounded thin and harsh, not full like the Studio Pros.

When I compared them to my other Bluetooth headphones, I couldn't justify keeping them in the collection. To be fair, there was a lot to like about them: the iPhone and Android compatibility, the folding design, the carrying case, and the look/style. However, the comfort and sound were just too much of a negative for me.

I can see that many people will like these a lot, and I'm glad. They fill a niche and they fill it well. But for me, there are just too many other options I like better.",3,B0CZPHPJLN,"I always one ignore Beats headphones, recently, I decided try pair Beats Studio Pros irresistible sale.

#2 heat. This thing gets HOT when charging your phone. Again, warm is definitely expected because of how it works, but similar other ones I have get no where near as hot as this one does.

The accuracy is not incredible; it said she was 5 ft away when in reality she was probably 20 ft away. I don’t have much fear that she will venture outside but I do want to be able to find her in my small house or otherwise I will go days without seeing her. The chirping does help and I hope that I can condition her to come out when she hears the chirp. The chirp isn’t loud or scary for her. I have to be within 30 feet to hear it. I recommend getting a harness to hold the AirTag because it can be bulky around the neck of any cat big or small. I tried it on a harness I already had and just added a keychain holder attached but she did not like the clunking when she tossed and turned in her sleep.

86,90,90,"A startling, occasionally disquieting virtual reality experience for all","First, a little background. I'm 73 years old. Above average in the activity department, adept mentally, although I am literally the only person I know who can lose something when standing perfectly still. I have four grandchildren. I hold down a full-time job as a writer, and a once-a-year gig teaching Rio Grande Board Games at the annual World Boardgaming Championships (WBC).
It was at the most recent WBC that I was introduced to MetaQuest 2 and in particular, its bundled game called Beat Saber. I'd tried much cheaper VR systems, the ones that hold your phone and you have to download apps to run on them. This was an entirely different ball game. This was, I should note, not a function of the WBC. It just so happened that one of the site administrators had brought the system along with him and one evening, invited me to give it a try.
The first issue that one should note is that once you put the headset for this system on, you are pretty much detached from the reality around you. This is fine as long as it's just you and the machine, but you can forget about being outside the machine and trying to instruct someone inside the machine about what's going on. As it happened, the man who introduced me to the system basically set it up for me - put it on his own head, clicked the right buttons - and then transferred the headset to me. With a couple of hand prompts and a word or two, Beat Saber, the program that comes with the MetaQuest 2 when you buy it these days, came on line and there I stood, with two controllers, one in each hand, as my eyes beheld on the screen in front of me, a series of square blocks coming at me, each with an arrow, pointing either up, down, right or left. The controllers operate two light sabers, one in each hand, and the object of this game is to swat the approaching blocks in the direction indicated by the arrow on them. There are also occasional large obstacles coming at you, like skinny walls, which appear like three-dimensional line drawings as they approach. You can't swat these aside and the idea is to avoid them. In most cases, this entails just stepping out of their way, either to the right or the left, but dependent on some choices you make in Beat Saber, some of these objects can be wide and impossible to avoid unless you duck as they approach. No way to jump over them.
And there's music. At first, you don't pick up on the idea that your swatting activity with the light sabers can occasionally be rhythmic, linked to the beat of the music. . .Beat Saber. Get it? But you'll pick up on that fairly quickly. If you don't dance and would like to, this is a good program that will force-feed you the concept of moving your body in beat with the rhythm of a song. You don't realize you're dancing because as far as you're concerned, you're swatting colored boxes with virtual reality light sabers. A note of caution. People familiar with the system and how it works will delight in recording video of your attempts to play the game; unbeknowst to you, 'cause you're wrapped up in the headset and can't see anything but what the machine is giving you to see. These people recording you will be LOL-ing themselves breathless, as you contort yourself in a relatively confined space, trying to dodge things and swat at the colored boxes.
I made the mistake of failing to heed the warning that if I didn't buy one of these systems soon, its price was going to go up. A lot. And it did. But I bought it anyway and am just beginning to tap into the available free apps and exploring the possibility of buying other ones.
There's a free Epic Roller Coaster app, which is fairly enjoyable, although oddly enough, both myself and my wife (now at home with our own MetaQuest 2) found ourselves getting a little queasy during the experience. Not sure what that's about. She NEVER goes on real roller coasters and I do it all the time.
Also found a walking-on-a-building-skeleton app that had me God knows how many stories high and though not generally afraid of heights (acrophobia), I wasn't all that keen on walking on the available, skinny steel walkways to approach the edge. I'm in my living room, my mind knowing damn full well that I'm not only not as high as the program makes me think I am, but am, in fact, on solid ground. Yet, in an attempt to approach the edge and have a look OVER the edge, I am literally creeping forward, edging my foot out in front of me, making sure of my balance with each step. My mind absolutely refuses to grasp the concept that I am not in any danger.
It should be noted that when you play in virtual reality, the mechanism has you define a space where you are going to be, literally drawing a perimeter line. It's not because the machine is worried you might step off the big building you only think you're on, but when you're playing a game like Beat Saber, you want to make sure that your arm movements don't knock over a lamp your Aunt Ethel gave you for Christmas last year, or in moving your legs around, you don't accidentally kick the screen out of your new Smart TV.
I haven't been too excited by any of the first-person shooter kind of apps that are available. That kind of activity never lured me to the various systems that were already on the market. But I did notice and have been on the verge of pulling the trigger on some of the other activities, like table tennis, actual tennis and some other sports activities, like baseball. Am also interested in what is, at present, a small selection of board games, like Tsuro and chess (in a variety of different environments). They offer Catan (originally, Settlers of Catan) and though my interest in board games is strong, I never really liked Catan in real-time, so I'm not going to pick it up in VR.
I recommend this system highly. The experience of good VR (and you can buy systems better than the basic one that I purchased) is mind-altering. It's something to which your mind has never been previously exposed; an alternate reality with its own set of rules that takes some getting used to. It's more expensive than pot, but unlike pot, it doesn't just let your head create new connections and free it from everyday anxieties, it creates a reality within your brain that is intriguing to watch, hear and interact with.
And as my age indicates, fun for all ages.
Oh, and one other cautionary note for those of a certain advanced age. The first time I tried the system, at the WBC, my score at Beat Saber was abysmally low. So I tried again. And again. It wasn't my hand movements with the controllers or the side-stepping away from approaching objects that got to me. It was the ducking at things that I had to let go over my head. I made the crouching moves necessary with reckless abandon. Once, again, and again. My upper thighs complained to me all of the next day. The good news is that it makes for good, healthy exercise.",5,B099VMT8VZ,"First, little background. I'm 73 years old.

87,91,91,Holy Cow!,"I just finished a rather challenging online degree program the other day and decided I owed myself a little something to celebrate.  I had just enough cash to buy one of these and thought I’d see if it was all I’d hoped it might be.  Holy freakin’ crap!

I was lucky enough to have a little spare cash on hand so to celebrate finishing my classes I bought myself a MetaQuest 2 VR headset package from Amazon.  I did the initial set up tonight which was itself amazing.  I have a virtual home that’s my startup lobby for everything and my home is on a space station complete with huge windows with a bright nebula outside and shuttles flying past docking at the station.  When I need to access any menus etc., a window just opens up in the air in front of me and with my bare hands I can just tap any commands or instructions I want onto it and it whisks me away to wherever I’ve instructed it.

After setting it up I finally gave a shot to my first free, fairly rudimentary game which is pretty much a first-person shooter game.  When it loaded up I was in awe as I found myself standing on a high pedestal inside a gigantic flaming stadium where a fleet of mean looking drones start opening fire on me from every direction.  I can see I have guns in my hands that are like blasters from Star Wars and I have to shoot down these attacking drones while I’m spinning in circles trying to pick my targets, and not fall off the pedestal while I’m firing a barrage of neon pink energy bolts at them.  At one point I found myself with each arm outstretched straight out to my left and right sides and was just twirling in a circle firing while spinning and just found myself giggling like a little kid.  I’m really stunned at how real it all looks and feels when that headset is on my face.  I didn’t really think it would be that good, that all-consuming, or that real.  I literally felt like I was inside a real-world sci-fi movie and it was incredible!

Best thing is this little toy is also a very good piece of workout equipment.  There are a ton of apps out there like Supernatural VR that have you constantly punching flaming meteors coming at you while having to jump over obstacles, squat down to keep from having your head knocked off and can get you sweating, wiped out and sore in just a few minutes.  I can see this is going to be something I’ll be using like crazy.

Tonight I’m going to try watching a movie on it.  Apparently one of the apps I downloaded will play from my Netflix account, and put me inside a movie theater with seats, and lit aisles and the movie on a huge screen right in front of me.  Really remarkable.  I was excited to try one of these out and it turns out it’s even better that I imagined.  Best little toy I’ve bought myself in years.

88,92,92,Awesome.,"The only reason I got this is because my Son had one. And when i traveled to North Carolina to visit him, he let me play with it, now mind you, I'm a Wheelchair user of 40 years.

And I had MANY questions about this because I thought it was ONLY usable for people that walked and moved around. In MOST Cases this isn't true. IF you are in a wheelchair you ARE Able to use an Oculus. Most if not all games are compatible to use in the Sitting position, this I did not know from the beginning.

So i was able to play with his Oculus while visiting him last December and had a Blast, Now some of it was difficult cause some games required you to move your body so trying to use my elbows to move my chair out of the way of incoming bullets and dodging was more difficult in FPS type games. I managed some but was still a Challange. Some of the other games uses the Hand controls top hats to move your character around and such so playing basketball or fishing or some other games was a little easier as I could just walk my character with the thumb sticks to get him/her to move around.

So with that in mind, When I found it on sale for the first time ($200) I bought one. We recently went back to visit our son in North Carolina and intended on playing some games with him since we both have 1 now. But unfortunately, that didn't happen, I landed in the hospital for a week with a bad infection so couldn't play any games.

But I'd recommend this for anyone walking or sitting. Has some great games usable in both sitting and standing position.",5,B099VMT8VZ,"The reason I got Son one.

I'll be the first to admit that I have my reservations, but even though I'm old and can't get it started, I don't think you're ever too old to try something new, especially something like this that lets you experience something new You don't have to leave the comforts of your home to experience something you've never experienced before.

This has got me up and moving, away from a mostly sedentary lifestyle to an hour or two of fun filled cardio per day - easy to get up and do anytime the spirit moves me. The realism of spectacular settings in Supernatural is amazing but the 3D effects in beat saver are fun too. I’ve also enjoyed occasionally watching a movie or two. With the headset it feels like watching on a big screen in a movie theatre. New to using so I’m sure there is much more to explore. Wearing the headset takes a bit of getting used to - if I replace it in future I am hoping to find one that is not quite so heavy on the head…Anyway, I highly recommend.

91,95,95,Lets Escape Reality,"The Meta Quest 2 VR headset is a notable advancement in virtual reality technology, offering several key features and improvements over its predecessor. Here is a comprehensive review based on its specifications, performance, and overall user experience.

Design and Comfort:
The Meta Quest 2 is lighter and more comfortable compared to the original Quest, featuring an improved strap system and a more balanced weight distribution. The adjustable straps ensure a secure fit, and the optional Elite Strap accessory enhances comfort for extended use. The headset's minimalist white design is aesthetically pleasing and modern.

Display and Performance:
Equipped with a higher resolution display of 1832 x 1920 pixels per eye, the Meta Quest 2 delivers crisp and clear visuals, significantly reducing the screen door effect. The increased refresh rate, which can go up to 90Hz, provides smoother motion and a more immersive experience. Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 platform and 6GB of RAM, the Quest 2 offers substantial performance improvements, enabling more complex and visually demanding applications.

Controllers and Tracking:
The Meta Quest 2 includes updated Oculus Touch controllers, which are more ergonomic and provide improved tracking accuracy. The inside-out tracking system uses external cameras on the headset to track movement, eliminating the need for external sensors. This makes the setup process straightforward and user-friendly.

Software and Content:
The Quest 2 supports a wide range of VR content from the Oculus Store, including games, educational experiences, and productivity applications. It also offers backward compatibility with Quest 1 titles. Additionally, the headset can be connected to a PC via Oculus Link, allowing access to the vast library of PC VR content on platforms like SteamVR.

Ease of Use:
Setting up the Meta Quest 2 is simple and quick, with clear instructions provided through the Oculus mobile app. The headset's wireless nature and built-in tracking make it convenient for users who do not want to deal with cables or external sensors.

Battery Life:
The Quest 2 offers an average battery life of 2 to 3 hours, depending on the intensity of the usage. While this is adequate for most sessions, it may require frequent recharging for extended use. The Elite Strap with Battery accessory is available for those who need longer playtime.

Privacy and Data:
One area of concern is the requirement of a Facebook account to use the device, which raises privacy and data security questions for some users. Meta has stated intentions to provide alternatives, but this remains a notable point of contention.

Price and Value:
Starting at a competitive price point, the Meta Quest 2 is one of the most affordable high-quality VR headsets on the market. It offers exceptional value given its advanced features, performance, and extensive content library.

Conclusion:

94,98,98,Amazing But..,"Pros:
- Fairly Immersive.
- Amazing experiences.
- Personal home theater, huge movie screen, made even better with paid Virtual Desktop ($20usd) that gives you actual movie theater vibes and tons of other scenes. Oculus link (Free) does a pretty good job with big screen too.
- Nice desktop experience in VR through Oculus Link (free)
- High refresh rates up to 120hz (if you're wired and can find a game that supports it)
- Haven't seen other views to compare, but I'm very satisfied with the resolution. And hear its better than most if not all other VR headsets right now while also keeping in mind its the most compatible with VR games. Im guessing this is the Playstation or XBOX of Virtual Reality. Or they are lining up to be. Either way, its the right choice for gaming and other.
- Truly the next level in gaming and virtual spaces like home theater.
- Gonna list Half Life: Alyx as a pro. Was my first VR experience, and although god-tier amazing, I would suggest working up to it as not much has compared since :P But I am having fun in other games like Boneworks and TWD Saints and Sinners. I like TWD more so far but I have a few gripes with that game. (Not a reflection of this product)
- As anyone would tell you, works well with streaming services. You got your Netflix Hulu and Disney plus.
- You can load movies and videos from your pc stored into Oculus directly for trips without wifi.

Cons:
- Good thing I already owned a beasty gaming pc. You're gonna need one for titles like Half Life: Alyx.
- Battery life. Could not watch a 2hr30min movie without plugging in. Con still offset by the amazing movie theater-like experience. Was using Virtual Desktop so maybe the wifi usage played a part.
- Real Con, the strap it comes with is uncomfortable and will give you a headache the first week or so.
- It is heavy on the front and my forehead and cheeks hurt, requiring me to take a break, wash and massage my face every couple of hours, every day. (I've watched videos on how to adjust and not over-tighten but not much can be done about the reality of the situation. It is far from weightless and fairly noticeable.
-If you need glasses to see things far away, you will need glasses for the VR headset too. Special lens caps cost roughly between $60 and $100USD. But it comes with a spacer. You can likely get away with those retro non-spacer glasses.If they have those little feet that push off the nose you might be in trouble and if they are really big, you might be in trouble so look into the dimensions of the quest 2 view port and your glasses. An annoying extra step but probably worth it.
-Scuba Diver effect. The view cant be in the pro section. As I said, you'll feel like a scuba diver. Only during the most immersive of times will you not notice too much. To be fair this is.. most of the time.
- blurring and lens-rings. If not absolutely perfectly centered, you'll get some blurring in various parts of your view. At first and for a few days the little magnification rings of the actual glass piece of the lenses will be very noticeable in your peripheral. Again to be fair.. again, while having an amazing time, you will not notice.
- Also there's this thing about the lens spacing I hear a lot of people complaining about. I think I'm just at the edge of the farthest setting but could probably do with a tiny bit more. Read other reviews and look into it about I forget what its called, the space between both your pupils.
- It'll take a few days or more than a week for your mind to ignore some of these, like the rings, occasional blur, and scuba effect.
-Serious con, be ready to shell out at least another $100usd or so on extras. $19 link cable $16 extension cable plus breakaway protection, Silicone Grips and hand strap (worth it and kind of necessary for throwing objects in comfort,) $30 Rechargeable batteries or a large supply of AA’s. Be sure either are 1.5v. $10-30. Head Strap pad I bought $15 (not compared to $30-50+ or so elite straps. And if you need the prescription lens caps another $60-100. And your first game ranges from $10-40usd or so, for the good stuff.
- Very few free games/stuff. And not that many AAA amazing titles. (Not exactly a reflection of this particular product)
-This thing gets sweaty after a few dozen minutes of intense gameplay so have a dry cloth handy and don't get pulled into the ‘pass it on or around after playing beat saber to your friends’ fantasy.

IMO/SideNotes Related to this product directly and VR as a whole:
- The device should have been a more evenly weight-distributed helmet.
- I wouldn't expect to game any more than an hour or two without being plugged in either to a power outlet or pc. Mileage may vary.
- Buy a 10 - 20 ft data cable with your purchase. The provided cable is like 3ft or something. You're gonna need it regardless of pc ownership. Search youtube for good 3rd party brands it should cost around $18-28usd or so for a good cable with decent length.
- Find your play area and hold your arms out, now plan for an additional one or two feet, mainly North, West and East of you. The Quest 2 comes with a 'Guardian' thats really good at letting you know when you're 'out of bounds' but you will be bending to search or grab stuff reaching and leaning over, tossing things aside (In VR, While stationary, with one or two steps of leeway) make sure you have the space to be swinging your arms around like that. be honest with yourself about this space. If you don't have it, you don't have it. Sorry. I had to rearrange my room a little but luckily I had the space and it was absolutely worth it.
-VR is very physical. Some games have seated options but require too much leaning and grabbing and searching to do it sitting down. So be ready to stand and crouch and lean. I kept that from both pro’s and cons. IMO, awesome, but be ready for it. Make yourself take breaks every half to sit and stretch if you're not used to standing all day, but not even taking into account the workout apps, this has gotten me burning more calories and keeping my redstuff circulating more and my metabolism on its toes. Actually crouching behind cover is pretty cool but also tiring lol.
- IMO, Probably not a con, too many older games being remade or re-released in VR. Don't get me wrong, Fallout 4 with Whispering Hills mod was and is mindblowing but after putting in so many hours on the pc version and playing it for years, its kinda hard to get all the way into again. But I guess for kids who never ever played Fallout 4 and they get it for VR, then it’ll be pretty awesome for them. Same for Resident Evil 4 Which I played on the Gamecube, not in VR yet but I fear the novelty will wear off as I played that game like crazy already and it would be a massive retread - even if VR itself is still amazing, I’ll stand by that. (So not a direct reflection of this product)
-I want to see more completely brand new AAA single player games.
-I hear GTA San Andreas is coming to VR.. Again, great for kids, but how about a brand new GTA VR?.
- Only been in the scene a few weeks but, looking back and ahead, it looks like a really lazy and slow march into making VR a thing for everyone. IMO right now it's still more of a niche enthusiast thing. I only say that because I’ve been hearing about VR for years. What did people play on the Quest 1?
- Get a small rug or mat to stand on, maybe even a towel will do so you know when you're stepping off too far out of bounds. I have a small rug I folded up just enough to fit my feet with a little bit of slack on all sides. This’ll make you more comfortable but will also help keep you stationary and orient you. They sell $100 tough gamer standing pads about the size of the guardian, if you have the dedicated space and money for it, I can't stop you I guess, but a simple, thick rug or small yoga mat will do.
-Like a baseball plate, add a little point when you draw your guardian space to let you know which way you should be facing at all times, you want that wire mostly behind you at all times.

I have more to say but admittedly this is getting long. I would wait a couple of years until a much lighter and more comfortable VR device comes out. But, if you cannot wait any longer and love gaming or just want what VR has to offer. I can tell you that, it is here, and it is amazing.

Seeing previews of anything VR on a 2D screen cannot do it justice and neither can words, of this you must trust me, you would have to experience it yourself to truly understand. Ask a friend or coworker if they have one and if you can try it. You wont believe it until you do. Or take the plunge like I did. I have my gripes with this thing, and it's not all fairy tales, but I do not regret purchasing it. Like I said before, it really is the next level in gaming, and it really is here.

95,99,99,"First VR that is truly ""entry level"", but with some catches.","Ok, I have to say, this is what I was waiting for. VR that wouldn't break the budget. On some sales, it can be had as cheaply as $200, which is amazing for a true VR system. Well, it'll be $250, and you get $50 back that you can spend on other stuff, like games, which you're going to need to buy for it anyway.

I also like that you don't need to set up sensors.. you can take it with you! That's so cool and conveniant!

I had heard bad things about the onboard speakers, but I found them to be quite good for what they are, and perfectly usable, with excellent 3D head tracking! If you don't like them, you can always just plug in some earbuds of your choosing.

The meta store has a nice selection of games and software that often go on sale, and have a fantastic ""sponsored"" system, where if you take someone's recommendation, you get 25% off and they get a $5 credit, and once you purchase and recommend, you get $5 to spend on some other purchase. I got quite a few cool games for $100, half of which was covered by my initial $50 credit. I'm more than happy in this area. Only complaint? The Meta ""library"" where you browse titles is kinda clunky, but I don't have hundreds of games, so it's ok for now. The games do have less depth and replayability than regular games, that seems to be the nature of VR.

Now, for the downsides.

- right off the bat, if you've tried other systems that are more expensive like Playstation VR or PC VR, you'll notice the graphics look.. um.. very primitive in games. The 3D processing power seems to be somewhere between a Nintendo 64 and a Gamecube, sorry to be blunt about it. However, developers are doing creative things to get around it as best they can. It is what it is, when you use ""budget"" tech.

- I'm not sure if it's due to the lack of external sensors, or if it's the weak processors choking, but semi-regularly the head tracking ""stutters"" which is really off putting, and takes you out of the game and immersion, and makes motion sickness worse. You'll be looking around, and even if it's for a few frames here and there, it's just not always smooth. It's not a total game breaker, but again, there are real sacrifices to using cheaper, simpler hardware.

- You will have to buy some accessories to get the most of this system. The headstrap that comes with it is functional to an extent with casual games and short playtimes, and VERY travel friendly, being just an elastic strap, and the battery life is very short for the syste, but the good news is, there's lots of choices out there for better headsets that have built in extended batteries, and they're not super expensive. I picked up a black friday headset with a built in battery for $25. That's great! I also recommend a carrying case to keep the system all together and safe.

I haven't tried linking the system to my PC, but I've heard that can bring out even more possibilities to what games you play.

So that's about it so far. I have heard a complaint that Facebook can take your whole system offline if you get reported on your facebook account, so that's horrifying. maybe don't use your real facebook account when you setup the system just to be safe.

Summary: the best system on a budget, with some drawbacks. I think if money is tight but you want your kids to experience VR, this is perfect. That's where I'm at, so I'm happy with it.

I charged it fully flipped on the light and then just set it on the window sill where the sun lit up the LED array I thought meaning it was charging.

Next I plugged it in to the AC to charge and then fool me twice when grabbed it in case when I was out and about my phone needed charging.

Another FAIL when I needed it.  With a fill charge in the wilderness the notion of a charge from the sun at this point was laughable.

Lastly I would leave it plugged in and again on the window sill.  Went to try to use it again and now it is dead as a door nail - NOT a flicker from any of the LEDs, and of course the flashlight didn't work.

The actual solar power capabilities are also so unbelievably weak. Unless you plan on leaving the device in the sun the entire morning and using in the evening or something like that, you will almost always have to charge with the cable.

What I did like about this power bank was that it was a pretty solid size - not too huge but not small either. It was easily portable and very durable - aspects which were crucial for my work.

119,123,123,"A lot better than you'd think, and on sale, an absolute bargain.","My wife needs a TV with sound on to sleep. I need quiet and dark. I've been using silicone earplugs and sleep masks for years. I decided to take a chance on these as I was tired of waking up with aching ears and dry eyes. I made a good choice and I'd recommend it to anyone.

I expected it to be heavy and bulky, and it is not. The foam padding around your eyes creates a space so the mask portion does not contact your eyelids and therefore doesn't put pressure on them. Way more comfortable and you can blink with the mask on. Good for people like me who have dry eyes.

I was initially a bit concerned about the speakers on unboxing, you can feel them when holding the mask, but they are fairly flat, and in cushioned pouches on the side of the mask. This makes them moveable/adjustable for comfort, and it means you never really feel the hard plastic directly on your ear, even when laying on your side.

IF you press your head down hard enough, you can become aware of them, but using a pillow in a normal fashion, side sleepers (like myself) should have no issues with comfort. Battery lasts at least seven hours. Maybe more, but I don't sleep more than seven typically, so never timed it longer than that.

Bluetooth works fine, though the range is maybe a little bit shorter (could be my phone though, so I'm not assigning blame), you probably want your bluetooth sound source within about 1m (3ft) from you. Audio quality is good, not earth shattering. At this price point, very respectable. The speakers sound fine (no crackling or anything), but not a deafening amount of bass, more mid and treble balanced. It's manageable through an equalizer app on the phone though, so I get the ambient sound I use (rain on a tent) to sound good enough to fall asleep to.

My wife now says I fall asleep in moments and she is amazed (and maybe a little jealous). I just remind her that I sleep the sleep of the innocent and just, so nyah. :D

The sleep mask itself is quite nice, very soft and gel filled. The headphones work as well as my other headband, which is to say they work well and they're not uncomfortable to lay on as a side sleeper.

Unfortunately, the straps for this face mask make it uncomfortable for me to the point of not being usable. It uses wide velcro straps that don't rest properly on my head, so unless I tighten them quite a bit then the whole thing slides off my head easily.

124,128,128,"Comfortable mask, great sound","TLDR: The mask is comfortable. The sound is great. Yes, you can adjust the placement of the speakers.

I bought my mask right at four months ago for a business trip. (I have to have audio playing to fall asleep, but was going to be sharing a room.) This was/is PERFECT
The adjustable Velcro strap fits my large head, whether my hair is down or up. I do pull my hair up with the mask to prevent it getting caught in my curls.
Pro/Con: I think the foam around the eye wells did smush over time. I have long lashes. Initially I could even blink without brushing the mask, but not now. That said, as sensitive as I can be to my lashes touching anything including my own pillow, the eye wells on this are still deep enough that it's manageable.
The sound quality is excellent. Initially I didn't realize the speakers could move; found that out when looking for charging port. Hooray! Very handy to have volume buttons on the mask. I can fall asleep at whatever volume, and crank it up when Husbandman comes to bed and wakes me with his snoring. It drowns them out!
The speakers aren't perfectly flat, but they're also not uncomfortably large. I'm a side sleeper, I tend to be pretty sensitive to these things, and I've had no problems adjusting to them.
Battery life is great. I can let it play all night, sometimes two or three nights between charging, depending on how restless I am.

Here's the thing. It's been four months. I don't use it every night. Sometimes twice a week, sometimes twice a month.
It died in the night this week, and I can't figure out why. Doesn't light up when plugged in. IDK. (Dear manufacturer, I'm open to warranty options or suggestions on how to get it going again.)

135,141,141,A great addition,"I found this item after doing some research on what's available in the market. It's at a reasonable price point. It comes with two ways to display it to suit your needs. The touch screen is pretty responsive, I've had no issues with it. The size is perfect for our needs.
It comes with the optional subscription for extra features. I decided to go for it for a year and see if it is worth it. I would say that I wish it provided more for the price point of a subscription. Subscription is by no means necessary as it will do the basic functions without it. Syncing up my calendar is easy and fast. I notice it update within minutes of adding an event on my phone. Very user friendly. If you choose to add photos to it, my suggestion is to add small chunks at a time. I've noticed if I've selected more than 50 pictures, that the app freezes up and the upload fails. The photo screensaver (not sure if that comes standard or if it's a paid feature...) is neat and the kids enjoy seeing their pictures cycle through.

162,170,170,A billion times better than the Quest 2.,"UPDATE: Seven Months Later (Updated May 11)

COMFORT

The Quest 2 was so unbearably painful and uncomfortable for me, no matter what I did, that I ended up returning it a day later.

I was actually afraid that the Quest 3 wasn't worth getting because it weighs the same as the Quest 2, even 12 grams more.

But the Quest 3, with its default strap, is wonderful to wear. It doesn't feel heavy at all. I like how the facial interface, headset weight, and straps feel. I can wear the Quest 3 for over half a day without feeling any discomfort. If a person is experiencing discomfort, it is because they didn't adjust the straps properly.

TIP - ADJUSTING STRAPS

When adjusting the headset for the first time, the top strap should be adjusted first. It determines how high up or how low the headset will be on your head. And the most important adjustment are the headset arms because they determine how clear your vision will be and how comfortable the headset will be. You want to adjust the top strap and the interface until your eyes are centered in front of the lenses, and then adjust the angle of the headset arms until your vision is perfect. The back straps will determine how snug the headset will be on your head. I recommend making it loose and not snug, so long as the headset won't slide around your face. For those who ever experience discomfort, it's because the headset arms are not at a good angle which causes the pressure of the headset to be solely on the forehead which will go numb due to a lack of blood flow.

PASSTHROUGH IS AWESOME

I originally didn't care about passthrough and foolishly wished that they didn't upgrade it. I thought that Meta could make the headset lighter if they didn't add extra passthrough cameras. But the Quest 3 is not at all heavy and is very comfortable. Passthrough is important to me now. It let's me be entertained and productive while also being fully aware of my surroundings. Passthrough is important for apps like Virtual Desktop and Reality Browser (I was using Immersed at one time, but in addition to it being a buggy and flawed mess, they purposely made it so that the app will not connect if your PC is connected to one or more external monitors, requiring you to physically unplug them.) And some games use passthrough.

The Quest 3 passthrough isn't crystal clear, but it is definitely good and leaps and bounds better than Quest 2's. I have no complaints whatsoever and am really happy with it.

LIGHT LEAKAGE ISN'T A PROBLEM

There is a small opening around the nose area. It's very small and not noticeable. I have spent countless hours on the Quest 3 using all sorts of apps and playing all sorts of games, and that small opening has never been noticeable to me. In fact, it has been immensely useful. I can tilt my head towards the ceiling to peek through that opening at my computer screen if I need click on something but don't want to take my headset off. Having that small opening lets me keep track of my surroundings so I don't bump into furniture or stub my toe. If people seriously think that the small opening takes away from the immersion, they can get a cheap nose cap on Amazon.

SMART GUARDIAN

Another thing that I like about the Quest 3 is that there is a smart guardian. On the Quest 2, if you step outside a small circle, you get kicked out of the app that you were using and get told to create a new boundary which is very time consuming. On the Quest 3, I have my entire house as my boundary. Well, to be specific, I only drew the boundary in the rooms that I needed. So for me, the boundary including my living room, kitchen, bathroom, and hallways in between. It's so great to be able to walk around the entire apartment and be able to continue using VR and AR with no interruptions.

MEMORY SPACE

I bought the 128 GB version. If there had been a 256 GB version, I would have bought that instead and it really bothers me that Meta did a crap move by not providing us with a 256 GB version at the time of release. I didn't want to spend an extra $150 for the 512 GB version, and I still don't wish that I could go back in time and get the 512 GB version instead. But when the Quest 4 comes out, I may splurge and get a 512 GB version. Out of the 128 GB, 18 GB is being used for System apps. But before Asgard's Wrath 2 came out, I had around 30 apps and games installed and still had 51 GB available. It's super fast and easy to uninstall and reinstall apps, so it's easy to manage memory if I run out of room. Unfortunately Asgard's Wrath 2 takes up 36 GB of memory, so I have less room now. But after installing Genotype and Green Hell to free up some space, I will have 16 GB free now. Most games only take around 4 GB or less.

PRODUCTIVITY

I like using Virtual Desktop and Reality Browser when I am doing exercises, indoor walking, or indoor biking. It's cool that I can still see the virtual screens when I have my face buried in a yoga mat. The Quest 3 may end up being a life changer and game changer for me. It might help me be more productive and be a happier person in general.

LYING DOWN MODE

Quest 2 received the Lying Down mode in version 63.0. Quest 3 received it in version 64.0.

QUEST 3 - WORTH THE PURCHASE, NOT EXPENSIVE IF YOU DON'T BUY UNNECESSARY THINGS

The Quest 3 is something that every single person on this planet should get if they can afford it. It cost me $499 plus tax and came to $533. I didn't think that I would need any additional accessories, and five months later that is still true for me. I still don't need a different headstrap or extra battery packs. I just use a 15 foot extension cord.

I just can't get over how great the Quest 3 is. I hated the Quest 2. I don't know what other VR headsets are like, but the fact that most of them at least 200 grams heavier doesn't appeal to me. But the Quest 3 is delightful.

VR COVERS (UPDATE)

I could live without VR covers, and five months later my interface still looks clean and new, after brushing it for a couple of minutes with a toothbrush. But I decided to splurge and buy some VR covers. Two VR covers on the VR Cover website would have cost me $61.20 (after a 10% discount code and $9 shipping). On Amazon, it costs $38.46 for two VR covers (after $7 shipping and $2.50 taxes, and free returns) . The VR covers are extremely well designed and fit the interface perfectly. The improvement in comfort is minimal, but it probably does make a tiny bit of difference. It would probably make a bigger difference if I were to sweat a lot.

BATTERY LIFE

I use the Quest 3 while it is plugged into an extension cord. On some apps and games, the battery level stays around the same. On other games and apps, there is a small drain while the Quest 3 is plugged in but I can play a very long time. Some games use a lot of battery, but I can play for a very long time and the battery will still have 20-40% left after I am exhausted. But I have never had the battery die on me before I finished my gaming session when the Quest 3 is plugged into an extension cord. I definitely do not suggest using the Quest 3 unplugged. Two hours goes by too fast, and that is two hours maximum. If you are using some demanding apps and games, especially with passthrough, the battery will probably only last 45-55 minutes.

TIP - USE EXTENSION CORD INSTEAD OF BATTERY PACKS

I just use an extension cord in which I plug in the Quest 3 wall charger and link cable that comes with the headset. The extension cord that I use is a 15 foot one that I bought seven years ago for $15 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BYC1I) and it lets me go into every room in the house without unplugging anything. I just tuck the heavy extension cord in the front of my pants which just leaves the default Quest 3 link cable between my waist and headset. That default Quest 3 link cable is light and long enough, and I usually wrap it around my neck once so my controllers won't get caught and snagged on the cord.

APP - VIRTUAL DESKTOP (WIRELESS)

Virtual Desktop. I prefer it over the Oculus Link. If you decide to use Virtual Desktop, you only need to buy the Quest version (don't buy the Steam version), and then go to the computer browser Virtual Desktop website and download the free Streamer App for your PC. The free Virtual Desktop Streamer App is what streams your PCVR games to your Quest headset (so you can play them on your headset), wirelessly. By the way, wireless does not have any lag or loss of performance that I am aware of, so don't think that you need a cable to connect your Quest 3 to your computer for PCVR gaming. I think that it is better to use a wireless connection. It has been advised to have a good WIFI router and to use an Ethernet Cable to connect your WIFI router to your PC. I did use an Ethernet Cable, but my router is a four year old ARRIS SURFboard SBG6900AC Docsis 3.0 16x4 Cable Modem/ Wi-Fi AC1900 Router that I bought for $106 and it worked well, so maybe you don't need the best WIFI routers since my router isn't that great.

TIP - WIRELESS VS WIRED. SAVING MONEY.

If you use Virtual Desktop, you won't be using a link cable. And I absolutely loathe Oculus Link (Wired and Wireless), so there hasn't been any need for me to use a link cable at all. I just use an extension cord to keep my battery charged and I use a wireless connection for virtual desktop apps like Virtual Desktop and PCVR games. An extension cord is probably better at keeping the Quest 3 charged than a link cable connected to a computer. The extension cord I bought only cost $15, but the 16 ft Quest Link cable costs $80.

TIP - OCULUS LINK PROBLEMS

One thing about Oculus Link (Wireless) and Oculus Link (Wired) is that they might not work right unless you go to Go to Oculus Desktop App > Settings > Beta > and enable Public Test Channel and let the app update. I don't use Oculus Link, but that is important to know so please make note of it. Some apps and games only work with Oculus Link, but I have only encountered one or two games that only worked with Oculus Link and they were both game that I did not care for and uninstalled.

APP - USE VIRTUAL DESKTOP (NOT IMMERSED)

I like using Virtual Desktop to access my computer screen. It's easy to grab and move the window around, and it has Headlock so it can follow your head movements or even follow you as you walk around the house. And it works in passthrough mode. I also use Reality Browser, and I use Google Remote Desktop on one of the open browser windows. It is a much laggier experience than Virtual Desktop and not as clear, but this way I can get multiple windows. Reality Browser has a nice minimal interface, the windows are very easy to grab and move around, the screens can be seen from both sides of the window, and it works in passthrough mode. Immersed was a pain to use because the windows are too difficult to grab, move, and tilt around. And in addition to it being a buggy and flawed mess, the Immersed developers purposely made it so that the app will not connect if your PC is connected to one or more external monitors, requiring you to physically unplug them. Luckily Virtual Desktop will have multiple monitor support soon.

GAMES - ZOMBIES

Survival Nation has a nice open world with quests, fishing, metal detecting, and climbing. And there is a co-op mode where you can share the open world with three other players.

I also really like Project Terminus. It has a realistic and detailed world, and the atmosphere is great.

I also have Arizona Sunshine, Propagation: Paradise Hotel, Resident Evil 4 (VR), and The Walking Dead: Saint and Sinners installed. These are okay games, but I like Survival Nation and Project Terminus better.

GAMES - OTHERS

I really liked the first Red Matter game. But it was short and didn't have any replay value, so I could only enjoy it the one time. I played Red Matter 2, and I didn't find interesting at all for the first half of the game but the second half was really good. I even felt like crying during the ending.

I think that the Doom 3 VR experience is better than playing the PC version. It is more immersive and you can do more things like lean forward to peek around corners, move your flashlight in any direction you want, look around more freely at everything at every angle, and so on. There is a Prey (2006) VR too, but I was more interested in the Doom 3 VR.

I played a little of Asgard's Wrath 2. I never cared for Greek or Roman mythology or medieval stuff, but I gave it a try and sometimes enjoyed the immersion. Combat can be fun because I use my real arms to swing the weapons. But combat can also be frustrating. The enemies are always on top of me, and it is hard to put some distance between me and them while also throwing weapons at them, turning, and dodging. I actually dropped the game to play Survival Nation and Project Terminus instead.

I did have Green Hell and Genotype installed, but I felt that they were both too boring, so I ended up uninstalling them.

GAMES - FITNESS

Beat Saber is amazing. A must have. Beat Saber has good beats, requires quick thinking and concentration, and is a good overall workout. If you want to score an S rank or higher on each Beat Saber song, you need to make wider arcs when slicing the cubes. I also recommend adjusting the floor height to what you want, and then stand i[ on a chair to adjust the player height. This will ensure that the floor stays level with your real life floor, but will make it easier to reach those low cubes or to duck.

FitXR is good for boxing exercise, but I struggle too much with the hooks and uppercuts. They always register as misses.

Dance Collider is also good. It makes my arms a bit tired though.

Eleven Table Tennis. It's not as much of a workout, but it is a physical activity.

Izzy's Beach Games. It's not a workout, but it's fun and there is great eye candy.

APPS - CUSTOM LAUNCHERS

Lightning Launcher is great for organizing your games and it is free. You can easily create and rename groups, have certain groups be the default location for new apps, adjust the tile size of apps, change app banner images, change the app names, hide apps, and more. The UI and background looks very nice. I also like how we can disable the Horizon Feeds window from opening every time the headset is turned on or after exiting out of a VR app. An ""Unable to Access"" window pops up instead but it is much easier to close and much less annoying than the Horizon Feeds window. I originally installed Lightning Launcher because I had some apps from Unknown Sources and it was hard to get to them through Meta's Library.

Quest Games Optimizer AKA QGO ($10) lets you increase the resolution of games (not PCVR games) and apps. If you increase the resolution of Horizons Home, the environment and the mirror that you see when you first turn your Quest 3 headset on, there is a remarkable difference. Increasing the resolution and CPU/GPU usage will cause a faster battery drain, but for me that isn't a problem because I always have my Quest 3 plugged into an extension cord.

GAMES - PCVR GAMES

I have a laptop with GTX 1650 and i5-9300H. A lot of PCVR games are unbearably laggy and completely unplayable for me. Some games are playable with some or minimum lag. I am not really happy with my PCVR experience, and I blame PCVR game developers, OVR Advanced Settings, and especially SteamVR for it. There is currently no app or plugin that will let me adjust the movement speed of how fast my character walks or runs. I get a lot of motion sickness in the Contagion VR game, so I wish that I could change the movement speed from 100% to around 10%. There is also currently no app or plugin that will let me change the snap rotation angle (on the thumbstick). OVR Advanced Settings only lets me set a custom snap rotation on controller buttons but not the thumbstick. The only thing that I use OVR Advanced Setting for is to do an emergency y-offset when my character glitches and falls through the floor. Really, SteamVR should have options to adjust all three a.) movement speed, b.) emergency y-offset, and c.) custom snap rotation. I also don't like all the freaking popups that I get when SteamVR is running. The SteamVR window will pop open and cover my screen instead of starting minimized. It also takes up space on the taskbar instead of being limited to just the system tray. Sometimes, I even get a second SteamVR popup window letting me know that SteamVR has been updated, requiring me to click ""dismiss"" before it goes away. And if I have the SteamVR running on my laptop but my headset is not on, I get a ""Headset Not Detected"" popup that never goes away. So annoying! Starting SteamVR will also make five previously hidden SteamVR entries show up on my Steam Library even though I have them set to Hidden. SteamVR even messes up how my Steam Library looks like and will take every game from every game category and put them all in one category with the five SteamVR entries that I didn't want to see. I can get my game categories back by going to a new page and then pressing back again, but the overall SteamVR experience sucks.",5,B0C8VKH1ZH,"UPDATE: Seven Months Later (Updated May 11) COMFORT The Quest 2 unbearably painful uncomfortable me, matter I did, I ended returning day later. I actually afraid Quest 3 worth getting weighs Quest 2, even 12 grams more. But Quest 3, default strap, wonderful wear. It feel heavy all. I like facial interface, headset weight, straps feel. I wear Quest 3 half day without feeling discomfort. If person experiencing discomfort, adjust straps properly. TIP - ADJUSTING STRAPS When adjusting headset first time, top strap adjusted first. It determines high low headset head. And important adjustment headset arms determine clear vision comfortable headset be. You want adjust top strap interface eyes centered front lenses, adjust angle headset arms vision perfect. The back straps determine snug headset head. I recommend making loose snug, long headset slide around face. For ever experience discomfort, headset arms good angle causes pressure headset solely forehead go numb due lack blood flow. PASSTHROUGH IS AWESOME I originally care passthrough foolishly wished upgrade it. I thought Meta could make headset lighter add extra passthrough cameras. But Quest 3 heavy comfortable. Passthrough important now. It let's entertained productive also fully aware surroundings. Passthrough important apps like Virtual Desktop Reality Browser (I using Immersed one time, addition buggy flawed mess, purposely made app connect PC connected one external monitors, requiring physically unplug them.) And games use passthrough. The Quest 3 passthrough crystal clear, definitely good leaps bounds better Quest 2's. I complaints whatsoever really happy it. LIGHT LEAKAGE ISN'T A PROBLEM There small opening around nose area. It's small noticeable. I spent countless hours Quest 3 using sorts apps playing sorts games, small opening never noticeable me. In fact, immensely useful. I tilt head towards ceiling peek opening computer screen I need click something want take headset off. Having small opening lets keep track surroundings I bump furniture stub toe. If people seriously think small opening takes away immersion, get cheap nose cap Amazon. SMART GUARDIAN Another thing I like Quest 3 smart guardian. On Quest 2, step outside small circle, get kicked app using get told create new boundary time consuming. On Quest 3, I entire house boundary. Well, specific, I drew boundary rooms I needed. So me, boundary including living room, kitchen, bathroom, hallways between. It's great able walk around entire apartment able continue using VR AR interruptions. MEMORY SPACE I bought 128 GB version. If 256 GB version, I would bought instead really bothers Meta crap move providing us 256 GB version time release. I want spend extra $150 512 GB version, I still wish I could go back time get 512 GB version instead. But Quest 4 comes out, I may splurge get 512 GB version. Out 128 GB, 18 GB used System apps. But Asgard's Wrath 2 came out, I around 30 apps games installed still 51 GB available. It's super fast easy uninstall reinstall apps, easy manage memory I run room. Unfortunately Asgard's Wrath 2 takes 36 GB memory, I less room now. But installing Genotype Green Hell free space, I 16 GB free now. Most games take around 4 GB less. PRODUCTIVITY I like using Virtual Desktop Reality Browser I exercises, indoor walking, indoor biking. It's cool I still see virtual screens I face buried yoga mat. The Quest 3 may end life changer game changer me. It might help productive happier person general. LYING DOWN MODE Quest 2 received Lying Down mode version 63.0. Quest 3 received version 64.0. QUEST 3 - WORTH THE PURCHASE, NOT EXPENSIVE IF YOU DON'T BUY UNNECESSARY THINGS The Quest 3 something every single person planet get afford it. It cost $499 plus tax came $533. I think I would need additional accessories, five months later still true me. I still need different headstrap extra battery packs. I use 15 foot extension cord. I can't get great Quest 3 is. I hated Quest 2. I know VR headsets like, fact least 200 grams heavier appeal me. But Quest 3 delightful. VR COVERS (UPDATE) I could live without VR covers, five months later interface still looks clean new, brushing couple minutes toothbrush. But I decided splurge buy VR covers. Two VR covers VR Cover website would cost $61.20 (after 10% discount code $9 shipping). On Amazon, costs $38.46 two VR covers (after $7 shipping $2.50 taxes, free returns) . The VR covers extremely well designed fit interface perfectly. The improvement comfort minimal, probably make tiny bit difference. It would probably make bigger difference I sweat lot. BATTERY LIFE I use Quest 3 plugged extension cord. On apps games, battery level stays around same. On games apps, small drain Quest 3 plugged I play long time. Some games use lot battery, I play long time battery still 20-40% left I exhausted. But I never battery die I finished gaming session Quest 3 plugged extension cord. I definitely suggest using Quest 3 unplugged. Two hours goes fast, two hours maximum. If using demanding apps games, especially passthrough, battery probably last 45-55 minutes. TIP - USE EXTENSION CORD INSTEAD OF BATTERY PACKS I use extension cord I plug Quest 3 wall charger link cable comes headset. The extension cord I use 15 foot one I bought seven years ago $15 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BYC1I) lets go every room house without unplugging anything.

I use extension cord keep battery charged I use wireless connection virtual desktop apps like Virtual Desktop PCVR games. An extension cord probably better keeping Quest 3 charged link cable connected computer. The extension cord I bought cost $15, 16 ft Quest Link cable costs $80.

163,171,171,I wish I could rate it lower but... it's still market king.,"SETUP:
Q3 + Elite Battery Strap

COMFORT - 4/10:
To me, this is less comfortable than the Q2, despite being slightly better balanced (weight distribution is closer to face now).  Namely, the interior plastic now makes contact with my face, which digs in, making it uncomfortable.  This happens even at the furthest facial interface setting (for folks with glasses, which I don't have)... and that comes at the price of worse FOV.

LENSES - 10/10:
Compared to the Q2, this is much clearer, with a much more forgiving sweet spot.  In fact, it's so wide that the IPD adjustment seems to have almost no effect, and we can pass between players without adjustment.  That's wild, and very different than our Q2 experience.

COLORS - 7/10:
It's still an LCD, so expect washed out greys instead of blacks, muted colors, and no HDR.

PASSTHROUGH - 7/10:
It's cool, but was massively overhyped.  Do I prefer passthrough as my default view?  You bet.  It's nice to have a sense of my surroundings while in menus.  Is passthrough viable for things like reading texts and working at your computer?  Heck no.  It's a grainy (albeit color) mess of compression artifacts and distortions.  You'll give yourself a migrate trying to read small text or even the keys on your keyboard.  It's worse if your keys are backlit, as the glow bloom adds to the artifact mess.

I've had some issues with my Q3, namely in what seems like a loose lens or display panel or something.  The lightest tap sends my vision stuttering - which has never happened in hundreds of hours of the previous Q2.

CONTROLLERS/TRACKING - 9.5/10:
This still has occlusion and line of sight issues, like the Q2, but otherwise it's MASSIVELY improved.  I'm a decently ranked beat saber player, and my scores significantly improved when switching to the Q3, despite using a claw grip (which could interfere with the LED signal from the tracker, since it doesn't have the ring like before).

PERFORMANCE/SPEED - 10/10:
This is the most noticeable gain from the Q2 (aside from the usable passthrough), and you feel it everywhere.  Bootup is faster, shutdown is faster, menus open faster, apps/games load much more quickly... and I assume this has something to do with why the controller tracking is so good - it likely can just handle the tracking math much faster, thanks to the improved compute.

GAMES - N/A:
I've basically given up on the Quest store at this point, mostly using this for SteamVR via Virtual Desktop (which continues to work great).  I'm sure there are some good titles on there, and native apps do perform with much better latency than via wireless PCVR, but the visuals are just much worse in comparison.  For instance, Beat Saber is smoother on native Quest, but looks like a blurry mess (with fewer visual effects) than on PCVR - not to mention the lack of mod support without jumping through even more hoops than we have to on PCVR.

OVERALL - 9.5/10:
It's not perfect, but pretty close, and arguably hits the ideal mark based on its incredibly low price point.  If Valve finally releases a new HMD, will I buy it?  You bet.  Until then, the convenience of the Q3/wireless trumps all other headsets IMO.",5,B0C8VKH1ZH,"SETUP: Q3 + Elite Battery Strap COMFORT - 4/10: To me, less comfortable Q2, despite slightly better balanced (weight distribution closer face now).

164,172,172,I've had 'em all  -  This is BIG WIN!,"So, I started with the original Oculus Developer Kit 1, then on to 2, then the consumer Rift, Rift S, Quest 2, and temporarily had a Quest Pro (a great piece of tech, but too expensive..returned in 1 week). We've come a long way with Quest 3....

- The clarity of the new ""pancake"" lenses are a marvel after dealing for years with the now primitive,  Fresnel lenses. No more having to reposition the flipping headset around, over and over just to find that one tiny spot of clarity while their outer area remains blurry. These flat pancake lenses are just super clear all around, from edge to edge.

- The resolution bump from the Q2 is another nice welcome. The blacks are not jet black like you would find on an OLED screen (like the PlayStation VR2), but that would bring the cost up. When you're playing games or experiences, you won't even be thinking about it. Would you rather have fresnel lenses like PS2VR? I don't think so. In addition to these new features, the fieild of view has widened on Quest 3, another upgrade that makes a difference.
- The sound is beefier and louder. No more tin can alley like the Q2, and the fantastic spatial sound adds more to the immersion.  I went back and played some older games,  finding sounds that I've never quite heard on Quest 2, which really surprised me. The haptics are also very much improved over the Q2, though not as potent as I would have liked. The Pro controllers are more advanced in this department, as is the PSVR2.

- The controller wrap around rings over the hands are a thing of the past, and good riddance. These controllers feel great, and track without a hitch. I'm super glad that they are sticking to regular AAA batteries for the controllers. They last a sick amount of time, as opposed to the Quest Pro controllers which are rechargeable. Some people prefer that style, but I prefer having to simply replace batteries and continue playing, rather than waiting for yet another device to recharge  Plus, I remember getting overheating warnings with the Pro Controllers, and they never felt warm. If you didn't put the controllers down for a bit, the warning would not go away.  There's a number of complaints about this odd issue in the Oculus forums. Not sure if they fixed this by now, but I do remember the Oculus mods being dumbfounded by this ordeal.

The Mixed Reality / Passthrough
As someone who's been around the tech industry for over 35 years, this is a new level of entertainment. Mixed Reality puts virtual objects right in your real space. Imagine sitting on your couch, viewing your entire room, while watching a spaceship break through your ceiling and land on your couch. Following that, you'll view in amazement as alien fuzzballs start breaking apart the walls to your surroundings, trying to get in, while revealing a complete alien landscape as you race to catch those critters with the supplied blaster as they pop in and land on your floor, and furniture!  You have to see it to believe it. You're still in your room, but now all the walls have been blown out. This all works convincingly thanks to the new room scanning feature, which is something right out of the Matrix. You simply walk and look around your room(s) as it automatically detects walls and obstacles during setup.
How about playing a dungeon crawling board game ON YOUR ACTUAL TABLE, or break into a sweat as zombies smash through your doorways, and climb in from the windows. If that's too much, then why not set up a giant TV screen that would dwarf the real TV in your room. Dozens of games and apps already have been updated to support mixed reality, so there's already many things to try out. Every day seems to bring more.

The beauty of Mixed Reality is that you're not fully engulfed in Virtual Reality. You're still seeing all of your real world, but the virtual stuff comes to you! This is a wonderful way to introduce newcomers to VR who may not feel comfortable completely cut off from their surroundings. So,  now you can exercise with a virtual trainer, box against a computer opponent in your own living room, or explore your house which can be haunted with ghosts. All this can be done without worrying about kicking your dog, watching if your baby wanders away or smashing your skull into a real TV set.  One other advantage, it cuts down the possibility of motion sickness which can be a problem for certain people. The one big complaint about mixed reality - the passthrough is kind of fuzzy, so your real world has kind of a grainy film over it, and when combined with the stunning virtual objects, there's a stark difference. Good lighting helps the situation, but ultimately, it becomes a non-issue because once your play area is combined with the virtual world, you won't even be much concerned about the quality; your room  becomes the backdrop as your eyes are mainly focused on the virtual parts, leaving the whole mix to be quite convincing, and for this price point, to have this feature? Are you kidding me? It's amazing!

Of course, you can alway play in total virtual reality, because that's still the popular choice for hardcore VR enthusiasts. Speaking of which,  I've seen many comments on various forums where VR veterans were knocking mixed reality, saying things like ""who wants this?  I don't need mixed reality, I will only play in complete Virtual"". After a few days, I already saw a change of heart.  Now it's, ""oh wow, I never thought I'd get into this, now I want more!"". Yeah, mixed reality is here to stay and grow.

The comfort
Well, here's where I personally find a negative. The default strap provided with the Meta Quest 3 is similar to the strap on the Quest 2, however, this has a bit more stability, with its adjustable Y-shaped back. It's one of those things, you try on, and think - oh, this isn't bad at all, only to find shortly after, either your forehead, cheeks or both feel a bit too much pressure. It's not as bad as the Quest 2, as the Quest 3, doesn't protrude as much, due to its new design, but it's no way good for long play sessions. I simply purchased a 3rd Party Elite-style strap on Amazon.. so mission accomplished there as it's a very comfortable, halo-style ($37.00) which is the way to go.

Battery life
 ...is still short - around two hours, though some complained it's even shorter. I tend to use an ultra-long C cable plugged into an Anker power supply and I can go all day, and only take it off if I'm playing something like Beat Saber, or anything else that requires a lot of crazy hand movements.

PCVR
Like its predecessor, the Q3 will work with your PC Oculus and Steam VR games, providing you have a powerful PC. With the new resolution, wider FOV and lenses, PCVR games look better than ever!

165,173,173,For me good enough to work full time through VR desktop (long review) - UPDATE 2 months later,"UPDATE after more than 2 months of use: I am still super happy with this headset and I'm still using it daily as my ""work rig"". The only thing to add is, absolutely do find a better strap that lets you balance it on your head slightly loose, rather than strapping it tightly to your face, unless you're doing some vigorous gaming. As far as games, I can only play certain ones that are somewhat static, like Table Tennis  because I'm too sensitive to motion, but for productivity work, I have no issues with keeping it on for 10+ hours daily. For me this is not a toy, but an amazing tool. One additional note, I have now upped my default virtual monitor count to 4 (got a Black Friday subscription deal for Immersed to allow more than 3 monitors). I also ended up buying the extended warranty for the Quest as well, for peace of mind.
Some small beefs with the Immersed app: it takes too long from launching it until it actually starts and connects with your laptop, but once it's on, it's fine. It would be nice to have an option to just start it in mixed reality mode right off the bat, it's my usual way of working. Other than that, all good.

Original Review below ---------------------------------------------------

I have always dreamed of ditching my monitors and having just a VR desktop. I could work much more relaxed than hunched over a monitor, with my shoulder muscles cramping after a day of work. I already use my laptop  to work anywhere in the house, but that freedom limits me to a single screen. Note that I am a software developer by profession, and I typically spend 10 hours a day coding.
  I was actually very skeptical that I could do real work in text editors with this thing. I decided to give it a try anyway. I am very glad I did, and here's my take after 2 full days of use.
First, my setup: I use the Immersed app over wifi with my Windows 11 laptop. I work tethered with a 10 foot usb cord for power only, with a 30 watt aftermarket charger, which can charge the headset while still keeping it powered up indefinitely.  I started with the 3 monitors free Immersed gives you, but cut down to 2 to feel less cramped by displays. My coding is done in Eclipse and VScode, and the text is very legible. I was worried about the field of view, but it is absolutely not an issue. The pass through portal in Immersed is great to allow you to see your real desktop, with your keyboard and coffee, while the rest of your environment is some chalet in the alps, or a space station, or whatever. You can also work within your real environment, but with virtual screens floating in front of you, if you want (see my comments about passthrough further on).
  The first day was fine except after the first 8 hours my face started hurting because of the pressure needed to keep the headset in place. I powered through the discomfort and after the 10th hour it wasn't bad anymore. Today I added a counter balance velcroed to the back strap and it has been MUCH better. I can loosen the strap so it doesn't press the headset against my face, but it stays perfectly in place due to the added rear counterbalance. I do not feel the that extra weight, only the benefit of the lighter fit on my face.
 How about my eyes ? You may not believe it, but after I spent many hours with the headset, my eyes are actually relaxed much more than when using a monitor. I've been far sighted (had Lasik many years ago) and use reading glasses for normal work, but do not need glasses with this headset. Make sure you tweak the interpupilary distance adjustment as well as you can for yourself  to avoid eye strain. I believe that I may have a slight difference in strength between my eyes that strains them with regular monitor use, but with the Quest 3 and that adjustment, my eyes feel very fresh even after 10 hours of use.. Incredible, I know. Perhaps if you have perfect normal vision, you may have issues with using the headset, but for me it's improving my experience. On top of allowing me to stay relaxed in my easy chair when I work. It's only my second full day, and if my experience with comfort changes, I'll update this review.
  Some things to watch for. I've had to reset it maybe 3 times these past two days, with a combined 22 hours of use. One time because I started getting some strange glitchiness, like streaks of gray fuzzy lines crossing my field of view all over the place, or voice command errors popping up continuously when I didn't even use it and had turned voice control off. The restarts cleared things up. One annoying thing is that though the computer speakers can play through the headset in the Immersed app, you cannot use the headset microphone through the computer, for example in meetings or chats, so I have to keep the laptop very nearby so its microphone can pick me up. I'm sure that will be solved in a future update.
  The passthrough cameras work, you can see the outside world enough to do what you need to do, but not very clear by any means, especially if you're not in a well lit area. This is super minor issue for me, since the virtual monitors is all I really care about, and they are quite crisp.
  My big fear is that the headset was not meant for such intensive daily use and that it may die out on me. I guess we'll see if the Meta warranty is any good if that ever happens. I'm debating purchasing the supplemental 2 year warranty that is available to get within 60 days of purchasing the headset.
  One last note, if you want to try a very cool experience to get a taste of VR, I highly recommend the free Oculus First Contact app in the store. A fun but very well done (imho) demo of what you can do in VR - great for all ages.",5,B0C8VKH1ZH,"UPDATE 2 months use: I still super happy headset I'm still using daily ""work rig"".

166,174,174,First VR System I Would Recommend for Mainstream - Quest 3,"I've been tracking VR since Oculus 2013 kickstarter. It's been disappointing to see how much slower the technology has progressed than I anticipated. Now 10 years later the Quest 3 at $500 is really the first system I'd feel comfortable recommending to a non-VR enthusiast.

Meta subsidizes their headsets costs allowing them to undercut the competition. The hardware in this in any other system would easily have been closer to $1,000 otherwise. That said aside from the actual headset and controllers itself Meta skimps in every other aspect. Assume you will need to spend a minimum $100+ for accessories to actually make prolonged use of the headset comfortable and enjoyable.

Day 1 replacement should be the facial interface. The facial interface is so bad whoever made the decision to keep it should be fired. Its bad enough that if this is your first exposure to VR and don't know much about it you're going to think its miserable having this thing strapped to your head. As of this review Jan 2024 the best interface you can get is from AMVR. Its about $30 and its a  night and day different. Not only does it improve your field of view but it also allows more air circulation for reducing fogging. The main improvement though is comfort. Going from a deep pain in my face to not noticing anything was a huge quality of life. Oblik offers a customized 3d printed facial interface but it requires an iphone for scanning your face and costs around $80. I have not tried this yet but it looks interesting.

Day 2 should be the headstrap. I don't understand why Meta doesn't provide competitive quality accesories for their systems. Look at Destek, Bingbok, Bobo VR. All three have excellent head straps that again like the facial interface greatly improve comfort and potentially offer other features like much high capacity batteries with passthrough and hot swapping.

Day 3 get some controller straps. Included are strings that will at least keep you from throwing the controllers but otherwise you will have them hanging from your wrists or you will be gripping the controllers non-stop. I like AMVR's strap with battery compartment but other options that allow you to rest your hands will still be a big step up.

The Quest Link Cable for tethered PCVR and charging is $80. The problem is it maxes out at 3A / 5V charging which will not keep the Quest 3 charged if you have Wifi on, let alone Wifi, bluetooth, and running an on headset game. With all those off and doing PCVR 3A is enough to keep it powered for a very long time. Ideally for $80 the Quest Link should at least include Power Deliver PD charging for 30 Watt+ charging speeds that would keep the Quest charged.

I'm using a Cable Creations 16.5 10 Gbps cable. It doesn't matter how fast your cable is the Oculus software seems to rarely recognize it being over 2.5 Gbps anyways. Anything over 1 Gbps is sufficient. This cable is $55 and is nearly identical to the Quest Link and is a good alternative. There are some other manufacturers claiming 20 Gbps 100 Watt 16 foot cables but be skeptical. Keep in mind most PC USB ports max out at 900 mA unless they note otherwise. I added a Startech 20 Gbps expansion card with 3A charging that keeps my headset alive for many hours as long as WiFi is off. Battery burns about 50% faster if Wifi is on. Sinefine also has an expansion card with 10 Gbps 45 Watt ports that should keep the Quest charged even with Wifi on as long as your cable truly supports PD.

The Quest 3 has decent video pass-through allowing for really interesting Mixed Reality / Augmented Reality applications. As it also includes depth sensors this doesn't mean it just superimposes graphics over a grainy video of your living room. The software actually understands where walls and objects are. There is a small alien invasion game where aliens start knocking out your walls and ceiling invading your room. I've had these tiny ball like aliens pop around and hide behind desks and chairs. And when I peek around the objects they're actually there, when I look away and come back they persist. This isn't the cheap AR that was in mobile games and handhelds many years back that for the most part just ignored what was actually in the environment.

PCVR is where the really compelling content for VR is. Mobile graphics power has came a long way and there are some bigger mobile VR games like Asgards Wrath 2 and Assassins Creed Nexus now but the reality is for the most part on-headset content looks like games from 10 - 15 years ago or more. However, on PCVR there is content that in the Quest 3 is sometimes nearly indistinguishable from real life. Usually just some object or in smaller closed environments. But its where the really interesting stuff is.

Unfortunately Meta seems to hate PCVR. Developers apparently don't have the USB access needed to allow PCVR directly. That's why apps like Virtual Desktop must be streamed via Wifi. Accessing Steam Games goes like this - Turn on Quest 3 -> Enable Quest Link -> Empty barren environment -> either go to desktop and launch game or go to SteamVR Home and then launch game from library.

A bit cumbersome and often games won't launch, won't launch in VR, or have poor controls without an easy way to rebind. Often games, even big ones like Pistol Whip have no native recenter function. In which case you have to bring up the SteamVR overlay to use its recenter function. If you launched the game directly from desktop though sometimes this isn't available and you basically just have to exit the game, launch SteamVR, then the game then recenter. It's very unfortunate but a lot of PCVR content is like this - very compelling if it works but can be frustrating and tedious.

I think we're still about 7 - 10 years away with hardware + software that really makes VR truly mainstream. The release of the UEVR mod that allows turning newer flat Unreal Engine games into VR games is a huge step towards that. But even with a 4090 many newer Unreal games still require turning many settings down to get smooth gameplay in VR.

TLDR - Unless you have cash to burn the Quest 3 is probably the best single package VR system available as of Jan 2024 but expect to spend another $100 in accessories to make it an enjoyable, comfortable experience. The most seamless experiences tend to be Quest Native applications, however, the most compelling and graphically realistic experiences are on PCVR. Though the ease of use of these can be inconsistent.

If you expect to wait for something better keep in mind the price difference between the Quest 2 and Quest Pro was over $1,000 so if a Quest Pro 2 comes out it could very well be the same. Valve has still not officially announced the Deckard but even if they do it tomorrow it likely wouldn't be available for at least a month, probably sell out very quickly, and almost certainly be priced at $1,000 or more. Apple Vision Pro is already expected to be priced at $3,500 and its specs are still unknown, probably won't be available till later in 2024, and it's unknown if it will be compatible with PCVR or they will completely restrict users to the Apple walled garden.",4,B0C8VKH1ZH,"I've tracking VR since Oculus 2013 kickstarter.

167,175,175,Worth the money,"I'll get straight to the points.
The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.

*The Good*

Excellent visuals. The graphics are awesome and the VR is so cool. The MR (Mixed Reality) is really cool too. With mixed reality you can setup a DnD table overtop of your own table.

Large library of Games and Apps. Everything from Classic zombie games in full VR to MR and Zen apps to chill and relax you. Even have Duck hunt VR. Yes, someone made duck hunt in VR.

The sound and video quality are really good good. Watching movies, anime and TV shows is really fun. It's like being in a theater without the sticky floors and the ""aww snap! Nuh uh and oh hell naw!"" Lol.

Easy to setup and use. Easy to change the head strap if you want a comfier or cushion type one.

Adding a compatible battery power bank is easy and suggested.

*The bad*

Quick battery drain. This is my only real issue. The battery drains pretty quick and even faster when using MR.
But that can be offset by using a compatible battery power bank or a 20ft USB C cable.

*The Ugly*

I can't say much here. The price for many is pricey ands if you want to play games with your family, they each have to have their own head set. That can get very expensive.
Unlike a console, you can't plug in a second controller and just go. Only you can see what's on your screen. This is definitely more of a solo system or making online friends type system. But if you can afford it, I suggest getting two for a family.

*Bonus - The Awesome*

Emulation 😁
Installing Retro Arch is easy and with 512GBs of room, you can install lots of classic games and play them. I know you can do that on a PC or buy a retro pie, but it looks so cool right on front of you and looking like it's a movie screen.
With the help of SideQuest, you can install CX file explorer and then Retro Arch and copy your classic games from you PC to the Quest.

And lastly for anyone asking or maybe those who don't have the extra cash after putting out the funds for this device.

I can't recommend pirating, but a quick Google search for Meta and the opposite of mother can help you with that problem.",5,B0C8VKH1ZH,"I'll get straight points.

168,176,176,"The best VR headset, hands down.","The meta quest 3 is the successor to the meta quest 2 and that is VERY apparent during both initial setup and usage afterwards.

Pros:
Clarity, Clarity is an absolute GEM with this VR headset, the pancake lenses are so good and clear that when I tried to use a quest 2 it was like looking through the pancake lenses but rubbed all over with Vaseline

Gameplay: the increased resolution and power compared to the quest 2 are absolutely insane. To put it in perspective, The quest 2 and 3 both do a game called ""beatsaber"" at a lower than native resolution. Looks a little pixelated but that's what the quest 2 could do. Quest 3 can play at the quality of a PC if you tweak it right (install mods to increase resolution, quest 2 would struggle)

Weight: The weight distribution is also better, even though the headset is only slightly lighter, because the headset itself is closer to yout face, the weight extrudes less meaning its less front heavy causing less strain on your neck.

Middle:

Comfort- Comfy headset? Heck yes! But not really with the included strap. The included strap doesn't really even out the weight and puts too much pressure on eyebrows, nose, and cheeks. I found that a halo strap (usually around $35+, mine is the bobovr m3 pro) is a MUST have. The weight makes it feel like you aren't even WEARING a headset.

Cons:

Space for glasses- if you wear glasses then you will need either an additional spacer for the face cover or lense inserts (I use the Zenni inserts, meta approved). They definitely helped a ton, before when I used glasses with it it put a ton of pressure on my face, which made it bruised in the middle right between my eyes, however, the lense inserts are so good cannot even feel them!

Misinterpreted con:

Battery life-

Battery life is technically worse, however, this is because of passthrough (most of the time, anyways). Passthrough requires the headset to process both a GAME and the environment around you, It isn't just a camera displaying an image, it's 4 cameras stitching together an image in real-time and sensing depth ad well as keeping track of where you are in the plane of the 3d vr world to ensure proper tracking. Hence why it uses more Battery. The quest 3 also uses more battery in heavier more ""intesive"" games that take advantage of the quest 3's extra performance over the quest 2. An easy and not too expensive remedy is a Battery bank. For games in which you have to move around I recommend the bobovr m3 pro or S3 because they feature Battery packs, the m3 pro has a 5000mah battery bank that increases battery capacity by around 2-3 hours and the s3 around 4-6. And these batteries are hot swappable meaning you can buy more, charge them as you play, and when your existing batteries die you can change them! For basically infinite playtime

I totally recommend this headset for anyone either still on the quest 1, sharing a quest 2, or as your first VR headset ever. Battery life isn't really a problem and a battery bank (18watts or higher) is a great way to fix any battery life issues you'll have, especially for Mixed reality passthrough games",5,B0C8VKH1ZH,"The meta quest 3 successor meta quest 2 VERY apparent initial setup usage afterwards. Pros: Clarity, Clarity absolute GEM VR headset, pancake lenses good clear I tried use quest 2 like looking pancake lenses rubbed Vaseline Gameplay: increased resolution power compared quest 2 absolutely insane. To put perspective, The quest 2 3 game called ""beatsaber"" lower native resolution. Looks little pixelated that's quest 2 could do. Quest 3 play quality PC tweak right (install mods increase resolution, quest 2 would struggle) Weight: The weight distribution also better, even though headset slightly lighter, headset closer yout face, weight extrudes less meaning less front heavy causing less strain neck. Middle: Comfort- Comfy headset? Heck yes! But really included strap. The included strap really even weight puts much pressure eyebrows, nose, cheeks. I found halo strap (usually around $35+, mine bobovr m3 pro) MUST have. The weight makes feel like even WEARING headset. Cons: Space glasses- wear glasses need either additional spacer face cover lense inserts (I use Zenni inserts, meta approved). They definitely helped ton, I used glasses put ton pressure face, made bruised middle right eyes, however, lense inserts good cannot even feel them! Misinterpreted con: Battery life- Battery life technically worse, however, passthrough (most time, anyways). Passthrough requires headset process GAME environment around you, It camera displaying image, 4 cameras stitching together image real-time sensing depth ad well keeping track plane 3d vr world ensure proper tracking.

169,177,177,500$ is misleading,"So this is nearly a perfect product, so ill leave the good for the end, what I will go into first is the bad

1) 128gb is barely enough if this is where you play games, 20 is eaten by system, and depending on games 20-60gb per game, and some games are things you will want to come back to often enough so removing them would just be a long term pain in the ass. 128gb costs meta 15-20$, 512 costs meta 5$ more, but it costs you over 150$ more... thanks meta

2) the devils jockstrap... it hurt my ears, it hurt my head, it was a pain in the ass to adjust, so right there is another 20-30$ to replace that, look up meat quest 3 and you will probably find what I use, its one of the best you can get currently and likely will still be among the best once the bigger brands put theirs out... the meta pro strap for 130$ is abject garbage compared to even bad third party ones

3) thanks meta for a cheese grater like cloth that actively hurts if you start to sweat, ho, the silicone upgrade will costs me 60$ but will still have glasses fogging issues? amvr put out a good one with an ice silk (that's what they call it) and pu leather face piece with Velcro to attach replacements, and unlike the stock face piece, it doesn't collapse in on itself when tightening to the face, great middle finger there to glasses wearers, there goes another 30~$

4) thank you zuck for your unfathomable wisdom in in a 5000 mAh battery that sucks itself dry in under 2 hours... this isn't the beginning of vr anymore, people have gotten use to vr and are capable of being in it for over 2 hours at a time. so you will need to look for either a 16 foot cable, trust me this is not ideal when you want to move around, something pc vr players have dealt with forever, but something quest players largely don't, so you will likely need a battery bank... oh what's this, qualicom QC is the standard used, fantastic, there are 0 good brands that use qc as a standard, the best I found was an 2000-5000mHa battery that says its 18000mAh, doesn't deliver the power it says it does, feel like it may catch fire with how hot it makes the cable, BUT it can extended gameplay another hour or so. this is a bit of a wash, I just wish they didn't use the worst standard for charging a device possible so I could get something from a trustable brand.

in total you are looking at about 100-250 extra in costs, beyond base model.

now for the good

wireless pc vr, as long as you have an av1 encoder or a hell of a good router for h264 form nvidia, you are able to run pc vr wirelessly,

you get access to meta games, pretty much the only vr store that gets active development and not just afterthought sloppy seconds.

the controllers last probably 10-20 quest charges in-between needing new batteries.

and if you understand how, most unreal games going forward and quite a few current ones now have vr though mods, along with several other games through mods, and if you understand how to get a 3d map to work from a depth shader, you can get near any 3d game to be 3d, though its a bit hacky.

you are also able to stream desktops to the quest, and the text is easily readable.

for games, even very basic ones that look like they could be from 20 years ago, its immersive in ways you won't believe. take the game compound, it looks like the first Wolfenstein game just with better textures, but because you are in the game and nothing is really making you acutely aware you are in a game, the graphics fade away, this feeling is just very hard to explain, but graphics you see on store or in videos do not do justice to seeing them yourself.

overall, this everything I wanted out of vr besides an oled display, its clear that hmd's are the future for displays, its just how long it takes to catch on.",5,B0C8VKH1ZH,"So nearly perfect product, ill leave good end, I go first bad 1) 128gb barely enough play games, 20 eaten system, depending games 20-60gb per game, games things want come back often enough removing would long term pain ass. 128gb costs meta 15-20$, 512 costs meta 5$ more, costs 150$ more... thanks meta 2) devils jockstrap... hurt ears, hurt head, pain ass adjust, right another 20-30$ replace that, look meat quest 3 probably find I use, one best get currently likely still among best bigger brands put out... meta pro strap 130$ abject garbage compared even bad third party ones 3) thanks meta cheese grater like cloth actively hurts start sweat, ho, silicone upgrade costs 60$ still glasses fogging issues? amvr put good one ice silk (that's call it) pu leather face piece Velcro attach replacements, unlike stock face piece, collapse tightening face, great middle finger glasses wearers, goes another 30~$ 4) thank zuck unfathomable wisdom 5000 mAh battery sucks dry 2 hours... beginning vr anymore, people gotten use vr capable 2 hours time. need look either 16 foot cable, trust ideal want move around, something pc vr players dealt forever, something quest players largely don't, likely need battery bank... oh what's this, qualicom QC standard used, fantastic, 0 good brands use qc standard, best I found 2000-5000mHa battery says 18000mAh, deliver power says does, feel like may catch fire hot makes cable, BUT extended gameplay another hour so. bit wash, I wish use worst standard charging device possible I could get something trustable brand. total looking 100-250 extra costs, beyond base model. good wireless pc vr, long av1 encoder hell good router h264 form nvidia, able run pc vr wirelessly, get access meta games, pretty much vr store gets active development afterthought sloppy seconds. controllers last probably 10-20 quest charges in-between needing new batteries. understand how, unreal games going forward quite current ones vr though mods, along several games mods, understand get 3d map work depth shader, get near 3d game 3d, though bit hacky. also able stream desktops quest, text easily readable. games, even basic ones look like could 20 years ago, immersive ways believe. take game compound, looks like first Wolfenstein game better textures, game nothing really making acutely aware game, graphics fade away, feeling hard explain, graphics see store videos justice seeing yourself. overall, everything I wanted vr besides oled display, clear hmd's future displays, long takes catch on.",0.101,0.704,0.194,0.9909,1
170,178,178,"Over good, Better with a  few simple additions","The  bottom line is I recomend it. I have  compared it  too all preceeding  models  and  can contrast it  with  a few  none Meta  options  as  well such  as the  Index,  Pimax,  and Window MR kits. If you  have decided  your  ok  with Metas privacy Issues you are getting  a nice  device. Its  greatest  weakness is  its Very  power  hungry and  as  I  write this there are few  options for power  blocks  and piggy back power packs  that  will keep  up. You need allot  of  wattage (30W ish i'd  recomend too be safe) like the stock power  block  puts  out, other  wise you  will lose  charge slowly.  Just  as  Quest 2  did.  Only  Quest  1 would  run all night  off  anything.  It was also a  bit  dissapointing  too find out that  it  doeas  not offer face  or  eye tracking, If  you desire that  you  may  need too  opt  for the  Pro at great  expense  and the cost  of  some  visual  quality. Quest 3 has exellent  Fidelity with its Pancake  lenses  and  high res panels, they combine too put Q3 on par  with  the  Pimax 8k x  and far beyond Index or other Quests. Its Tracking is  Only so so however, the removal of  upwards camers  effects  it  when  placing hands  above  or behind ones  person.  on the plus side  hand tracking  is  very accurate and  we  can  expect  it  too improve  with  updates.. Its  Room  scanning abitlity  is  very  usefull  the  new AR focuse of this  device  sets  it  apart  from  previous  VR only  devices.  Now games  can exist  in Real  space  and so  can  other participants. I see this  as the  future  of  VR so it has relivancy that may  last longer then other HMD's and  effect  more  titles  as Developers get  more accustomed too creating AR  content  for  it.  I found  the  audio  too be  noticably  improoved  over  Quest 2/1  although i  could  not  get a  good  test  with  the  Pro. I am  reminded of  Index  when I listen too  it  though it  does not  have the  Base  or  power of the  Index  speakers.  Still ,very  impressive  for  something so  small and  direction.  I find no need  for headphones  or  ear buds. As I mentiond its  got  great  looking  visuals with  only  2 caveats the  FOV has only  improved slightly  over  Q2  and in a  testing  envioment  its  blacks were consistantly  scoring a 4 on 0-10 black too white. So  basically it  does make  very dark  blacks. Though its  not horrible noticable if  you  are  not thinking  about  it  during  a  movie. I will  also  Recomend  a Light Leak incert  for  the  nose, they  are  about  $8-9 bucks I  use this  one : https://a.co/d/6yyfSZy. With out  this the Q3 has  a huge  light  leak  around  the  nose  but  its  comfortable even  with  the  incrt  installed. I give Meta  marks  for reducing its  form  factor  It is notacably  lighter and more  compact,  which  I  worried  would  make  it hard for  me too  wear  with  glasses. Instead I  was pleasently  suprised too  find  my  frames  fit  under it  nicely  and  Meta  formed the  interior  in such  a  fashion so the  lenses rarely  make  contact with  each  oth as most  other HMD's  do.  This  is  do  too  a small  rubber  lip around the  lenses that  protrudes.  Later I got RX lenses  made  for it  at a  discount  courtasy  of  Meta  and  the  snapped  right in perfectly  even  with  the protective  ridge. Returning too  the  Power topic I recomend if  you get  anything  be  sure it  has  Over charge  protection/smart  charging.  I tried  Some combo Battery and delux  head bands  but they  had bad  fans  and poorly  placed  Usb C jack prone  too breakage. So Untill a better  power strap is  out  Im Make  do  withe the  cheaper and  proven Rebuff reality battery which includes  charge  protection and while  not  fast  enough too  charge the Q3 it  can  do  a  decent  job of  extending  play  time: https://a.co/d/fPsh5hs along  with these Usb cables too reduce the  chance  of  breaking: https://a.co/d/5Ti1VlM and I  always  advise  a Magnetic quick  connect such  as this: https://a.co/d/7IDXYLZ Now my  Final  recomendation Is the  Knuckle straps as the  controlers  are still  a bit  slippery I found them  too be  over  price  but this  model  works  fine  at  a  reasonable  cost https://a.co/d/jld7EsV Thank You for  Reading  I hope this was usefull.

171,179,179,Tracking not as good as Quest 2 for Beat Saber E+,"I apologize now, for this review being so long, & all over the place, but I always give honest & THOROUGH reviews that you can 100% trust... I'm never paid to review anything).

Preface:  So I've had my Quest 2 for 3 years now, & absolutely LOVE it. VR has changed my life for the better in so many ways. The app Horizon Worlds has brought so many great friends into my REAL life, and has given me AND my 27yr old, disabled daughter so many things to play, explore, & experience! I'm 55 lol and I'm an Beat Saber (VR) addict. I love music with a good Beat which is what drew me to beat saber & I can't believe how far I've come playing it! I've played it every single day since the day I bought the Quest 2, 3yrs ago. So I can honestly say that I DO know what I'm talking about here.
  The Q3 does NOT track as well as the Q2 while playing at Expert and E+ levels. I noticed it immediately. If you don't play Beat Saber at at least expert level, you probably wont even have tracking issues.
I was told by so many ppl the Q3 was soooo great. Which, it IS great when comparing to my now 3yr old Q2, that I've played 4-8+ hrs DAILY for 3 yrs. I've gone thru 3 sets of controllers, put a few little scratches in the lenses, & it starts to heat up after an hour or so...& when you already have hot flashes, it feels like wearing an oven on your face. I guess it's because it's a more powerful headset. I still don't see that much of a difference visually... certainly not enough to justify paying double what the Q2 costs!
  I also love a social app called VRCHAT. The movie theaters are unparalleled, and the visuals in there are jaw dropping...especially if you connect the headset to a good computer...(which i dont have) But vrchat now requires much more RAM than the little 6gb the Q2 provides. VRChat requires at least 10-12 gb of RAM to see all of the benefits .. I was hoping the Q3 would have at least 10-12gb of RAM, but it only has 8gb! ggrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Since my Q3 is NEW, of course it's doesn't heat up .. yet.. we'll see! The battery only lasts 2 HOURS,  so you have to stay plugged in if you want to play for longer periods. (*tip if you arent rich lol*  Instead of spending extra money on fancy headgear with built in external batteries that only last another 2 hrs) I use my 20000 mah power bank and attach it to the straps behind my head using velcro straps. It not only counter-balances the headset perfectly, making it less heavy on your face, I have yet to play long enough to wear out the power bank!  My longest time in the Q2 was 9-10 hrs with still 20% battery left as well as 2.5 hrs on the headset... (don't judge lol I lead a very boring life lol) The Q3 does pull a lot more power..but it still outlasts me lol.
Yes, the Q3 visuals are slightly better (clearer & brighter), but STILL not $300 worth better.  I'm still debating whether or not to keep it or return it.. but for the Q3 price I could get 2 new Q2s! Or just get a new Q2 for $400 plus 3 extra sets of controllers!  My Q2 had 256gb storage with over half used.. so of course I couldn't get the cheaper one that only had128gb!! Good job META you really know how to make your money...Grrrrrrrrr!
However, I now have a headset with 512gb, and access to games not available on the Q2. I'm also afraid of Meta slowly fazing out the Q2 like they did Q1.
I haven't tried any mixed reality using the passthough, so I cant review that part, but the Q3 pass-through is not what they show it to be at all. It's more like trying to see under water. At least it's in color now. I'm not a big fan of mixed reality. I'm in VR because it feels like it takes you away from the real world.. like a little vacation with friends without spending money or getting dressed up or leaving the house! lol I don't want to be sidetracked or reminded of what I need to do in my house LOL.
  The controller battery doors are much easier to remove now with a push button thing that pops it open. These controllers also have no ring, and are a bit smaller. If you have huge hands itll probably feel like they'd disappear in your hands. I still prefer the feel of the Q2 controllers, especially for Beat Saber & Pistol Whip. I require knuckle grips to play those, which were much cheaper than the Q3 ones.
  The Q3 will draw a boundary for you, which is great if you are only standing.. or only sitting.. I still have to draw my own since I like to sit and stand depending what I'm doing in vr... but so far, it remembers my setting.
The Q3 cloth interface gives me a ""rug burn"" type rash on my face..maybe its an allergy idk. It's a weird material as opposed to the absorbent foam on the Q2, which I LOVED, because it absorbed sweat during my sweaty Beat Saber & Pistol Whip sessions .. and I would just wash it out every night with a little baby shampoo, squeeze it out & hang it to dry overnight. It never fell apart, and was always fresh & clean for the next day.  Now, I have to put my old silicone cover on it, which holds in the heat in and fogs up the lenses.. (I have hot flashes 24/7 so it's not fun). (I just ordered a different interface). Or ill have to spend probably 75-100 bucks when/if they make an interface with the little fan attachment. (The one for the Q2 is awesome btw!)  So farmers, not only did I have to spend over $700 for this headset with the added 3yr protection, a new interface, I also had to oder new controller knuckle grips that come attached to new battery doors. Thankfully, I had the option to make 12 no-interest payments over a year!!
  I'm praying these controllers will not drift like the Q2. Although, I take way better care of my Q3 after the lessons learned lol.
That's it so far. I'll add to this as time goes on.
In closing, I highly recommend getting either headset you can afford! No matter your age!! (But please..not for kids under 13! Do your research on that!!) VR is great for socialization, and exercise!! It's not only a game changer.. its a life changer! Don't listen to all of the negative Nellie's out there who just hate the Zuck lol.. to me it has nothing to do with him. It's all about what experiencing VR has done for me & my family!!
PS: 2 1/2 yrs ago, while my 82yr old Dad was still alive, I brought my Q2 to him at his nursing home. I showed him so many things he LOVED IT! He loved exploring fish, dolphins  ,  & prehistoric fish in the depths of the ocean..fed & played with dolphins .. traveled to places he'd been to while in the army, even shot virtual army weapons and went hunting! I believe they should have vr headsets available to all patients in nursing homes & hospitals..or homebound patients or whoever else doesn't have the privilege of leaving their home at will!

188,197,197,The Future of Nintendo Handhelds?,"Update (Feb. 12, 2020):

I originally gave this product 5 stars because the excitement of a brand-new handheld Nintendo console had not yet worn off. Now that I've been using it for a few months, there are a few things I take issue with.

The first issue I've noticed is that the eShop is PAINFULLY slow compared to other devices. I understand that the Switch is behind other consoles in general, but I think there's an issue when it can run Minecraft (a CPU-intensive game) better than it can run the eShop. I know that in my original review I said that the eShop lag wasn't too bad, but it can be at times. I really don't see the reason for this. I mean, it's not a smooth experience at all. The icons take a while to load sometimes and if I scroll too fast I have to wait for it to catch up. It's the same thing when I switch between the menus, too. And no, it's not my WiFi.

Now, the other issue I have is the home screen. On the 3DS, you could customize the icons however you wanted, you could put things in folders, and you could even have really cool themes! With the Switch, you don't get any of this. You get a dark mode and a light mode. That's it.

Now, if you don't care about these features that's fine, but I personally like having the option to personalize my devices. Also, it's painful having to scroll through the games you have installed on your switch because the icons are so large and you can't make them stay where you want them. It's just really clunky and annoying.

Another thing is if you're looking to you're looking to use your Switch for anything other than playing games, you're out of luck. There is no internet browser and no streaming apps. There is a YouTube app, but it's kind of bare-bones and you can't look at comments on videos.

So, for these reasons I had to knock off a star from my review. The only reason I didn't remove more stars is because I still believe the Switch is a great system with a lot of potential. I still believe that Nintendo should continue with this idea and I hope that they take people's criticism into consideration.

Oh, and this isn't really the SL's fault, but the screen is pretty small so certain games can be hard to play on it because it can be hard to see certain parts of the UI. Just something to look out for.

Also, I know some people have already been experiencing JoyCon drift with this console, but I personally haven't had a problem with it yet.

Original Review (Oct. 2019)
I really, REALLY love this system.

I don't own the original Nintendo Switch, and I got the Lite because of the lower price point and the lovely colors. I also wanted to play a lot of the games that are on the Switch, but not the 3DS. I was going to wait for the Zacian and Zamazenta edition to come out, but I decided I liked the turquoise edition better and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.

Now that I have it, I must say that I am very pleased with its performance. It runs faster than I expected from a system that is so small. I haven't noticed any severe lag (although it does lag a little bit if I go through the eShop categories too fast).

Speaking of size, the Switch Lite is perfect. It's just big enough that I can see the screen just fine, but not too big that it's uncomfortable to hold. Keep in mind that I am someone with fairly small hands, so a person with larger hands may find the buttons and joysticks to be too close/cramped for their liking.

The screen resolution is one of the highlights of this system. Compared to my 3DS XL, the screen is fantastic. Seriously, I didn't realize how bad the 3DS screen is until I compared it with this system. All the games look amazing, especially Super Mario Bros. U. Mario Kart 8 also looks great.

Another thing I like a lot is the form factor. I like that everything I need to see is just on one screen and that the buttons right there beside it. It's not that I don't like the clam-shell design of the DS line, it's just that this form factor feels more comfortable to me. Of course, the form factor does come with its downsides. For example, it's going to be a lot easier to scratch the screen and the buttons. But that can be remedied if you just get a screen protector and a case to put it in.

Another thing I like is that it comes with a charger. It seems like a no-brainer to put something to charge the device in with the packaging of the device itself, but guess what? When I got my 3DS, I had to buy the charger separately. Just another way for Nintendo to get money out of me, I guess. Luckily they did not make the same mistake with the Switch Lite. I also like that the cable on the charger is so long. It makes it easier for me to charge it and play it at the same time because I can get comfortable without worrying about holding my Switch in an awkward position.

Although there are a ton of positives about the Switch Lite, I do have one complaint. My screen came with a stuck pixel. That really annoys me, but because it's kind of a light green/white I can't really see it when I'm playing games unless I'm specifically looking for it on the screen. I can only really see it when I'm in the eShop. It does suck though that an otherwise perfect system would have a flaw that can really be annoying at times. And anyway, Nintendo has said that it's a common issue with the screens so I don't expect that they would do much about it anyway.

I was pretty disappointed when I figured out that the DS line of systems is pretty much dead now, but after buying the Switch Lite I'm kind of excited for the future of Nintendo handheld systems. I hope that they come out with more colors for the Lite and I also hope they expand upon this system like they did with the DS line.

Overall, I think this system is a drastic improvement upon the DS line, but beware of stuck pixels and the fact that Nintendo does not seem to care about them.",4,B084Y3VVNG,"Update (Feb. 12, 2020): I originally gave product 5 stars excitement brand-new handheld Nintendo console yet worn off.

Cons
Does not protect against lightening strikes if that's important to you

The components in surge protectors that provide the actual protection eventually burn out. At this point the ""surge protector"" becomes nothing more than a power strip.

This surge protector is nice in that it has a blue LED providing a visual indicator it is still providing protection, according to the sheet manual that comes with it.

222,231,231,This Book Lives on my Workbench,"Overall, this book is really great. It covers a wide range of topics. It presents some relevant theory and historical perspectives. And, it contains schematics of sample circuits and references part numbers of components currently in production. Keep in mind that the 3rd edition of this book was published in 2015 so there are definitely some more contemporary components out there but often they are still made by the same manufacturer.

One of my favorite parts about owning this book though is that it has often been quicker, less frustrating, and more illuminating than doing a simple online search when I first sit down to design a circuit. Of course, this statement should be treated with a caveat: I am not a professional electrical engineer. I don't have any educational nor vocational experience in analog electronics, and I'm not designing insanely complicated circuits. Most of what I have learned comes from this book, online forums, and technical datasheets from manufacturers.

Because of this, I would say it is an incredibly beginner friendly text for those designing circuits. It does contain math, uses technical vocabulary, and asks you to read a schematic/graph/table, but these are all well labeled, accurately defined, and clearly depicted. I haven't found myself lost because of a simple omission that the authors felt was too obvious to mention nor a poorly defined or ambiguous term. Needless to say, it sits happily on my workbench full of notes and a couple burn marks from my soldering iron.",5,0521809266,"Overall, book really great. It covers wide range topics.

223,233,233,The most important and inspiring book on electronics there is.,"To me, there is no one more important book in my life than H&H.  I certainly do not know of a better electronics text (and I like electronics texts).
Further, I believe my career in engineering boils down to a few distinct pushes in that direction before it was in my blood (and therefore too late).  One of the big ones was getting a copy of AoE 2nd Edition in school.

So, I would have bought the 3rd edtion no matter what.

Incredibly, the 3rd edition has expanded many of the things I loved about the 2nd edition.  The section on low noise design is much better and much more useful and it was pretty great before.  The digital stuff is obviously much more relevant (although it may not stay that way).  The &#34;circuits from the masters&#34; sections and the case studies of specific circuit designs are fascinating and useful (although I do miss the hilarious &#34;bad circuits&#34; sections).

Finally, and most importantly, you can tell that H&H themselves were active engineers in the world between the last edition and this one -- building circuits and solving problems and reading other works and being influenced by the work and scholarship and generally just continuing to rule.  The dedication to Jim Williams showed that like me and all other analog nerds I know out there, they had been eagerly reading all his stuff.  The section on microcontrollers exactly parallels some of the design ideas, biases, and gut feelings that I and other embedded engineers have taken the past fifteen years developing by plowing through all the exciting architecture and tool changes that have happened from EEPROM PICs to ARMs.

Finally, the intellectual integrity, raw practicality, and HANDS-ON-ness of this book are unparalleled.  If everybody were required to read this book before designing circuits, there would be a lot fewer crappy circuits out there.

Oh, yeah.  And it's fun, too.",5,0521809266,"To me, one important book life H&H. I certainly know better electronics text (and I like electronics texts).

To the beginner, this is an intermediate level book. Though it does start off with basic concepts of voltage, current, resistance, inductance, etc., the underlying tone is that you should have at least some basic grasp of these concepts to begin with. Very quickly it starts diving into somewhat more in-depth discussions on these topics, but it is still kept at a relatively moderate level. My last calculus class was 20 years ago, and while it helps my understanding of what is going on (electronics is full of differential equations, can't really get around it) the way they present the math you don't have to derive the formulas, most of it is boiled down to relatively basic algebra and maybe a little bit of trig. If you want the derivations, they're back in the appendices, but the authors state early on that they try to keep the complex math to a minimum.

I have had the book for about two months and am still on chapter 3, mainly because I find myself having to go back and re-read some passages several times. This is because the book is somewhat sparse with examples, and I'm more of a person who learns by application.

As long as you pick the correct label size, the software manages the spacing and usable space for you.

335,347,347,Excellent printer,"I love the small size. It’s a little taller than my 15oz coffee mug, same height as small box of Kleenex. The app is super easy to use. Printing is fairly quick. Print quality is fairly decent. It prints text pretty easily, but if you upload a custom logo or image, it’s a little distorted. The description states the labels are water and oil proof, but the ones that I have in cupboard beneath my sink and the ones on my stainless steel table have started to fade after getting wet. This is with the labels that come already with the printer. I’d understand having this issue if I were to be using cheaper labels from some other place, but to be advertising their own labels as water and oil proof is a little misleading.

I’ve enjoyed adding labels to things around the house since it’s so quick and easy to use. Its small size fits nicely in kitchen drawer or desk drawers. It has a built in wrist strap which you could use to hang it if you wanted to. I got the case for mine since it’ll reside in the kitchen and the case will help keep it clean. Having eight people living in our house is nice to add labels to things to lessen the frequent question of “where’s ______ item” after I’ve rearranged things.

I’d give this printer 5 stars, but had to deduct one star for the labels that come with being not water proof as stated in the description. Also, it took me a bit to figure out how to turn it off. The instructions that came with it only say how to turn it on and pair it with the app. I thought maybe it would turn itself off after you close the app and disconnect from the printer.  It would be nice if the instruction book stated “To turn off, press and hold the indicator button,” or if it would auto power off after you close the app.  For the price, this is an excellent little label maker printer. Another thing I find slightly annoying is having to have the printer connected to your phone to create labels. It would be nice if you could create your labels in the app, save them in the app, then turn on the printer to print.

Overall this is a very excellent, low cost thermal label printer.",4,B0C3L93F2Q,"I love small size. It’s little taller 15oz coffee mug, height small box Kleenex. The app super easy use.

401,414,414,Great find!,"I bought this because it fit simply into an existing double outlet, provide 5 places to plug things into AND has 4 USB ports (1 a C port), and a little shelf at the top to put your phone while charging.  Perfect for plugging in a table lamp, CPAP machine and laptop. I also bought it because of the nightlight facing down which can easily be turned on when you want, or set to turn on automatically at dark. Or you can set it for automatic lighting then turn it off when you sleep if light bothers you.  Very easy.
Think about what outlet to use for installation as being right close to the floor may result in dust ending up in the various holes (electrical and USB) and the nightlight being useless. This wall outlet extender is Easy to install. You'll need a phillips-head screwdriver.  First remove the existing grounded wall double outlet face plate and screw on a grounded double US-style outlet (requires a small, regular screw driver).  Insert the charging tray into the slot at the top, then carefully align the two long prongs into the grounding holes of the wall double outlet.  Be ready to engage the screw as you go.  (Don't remove the tiny piece of paper on the back of the unit holding the screw from falling out.)  When you go slowly, it's slick as a whistle! Takes only a few minutes.
It is good to know the capacity of item you're plugging into this extended wall outlet as electricity flows only from one outlet on the wall to the five outlets on the extended wall outlet.  You'll also want to think about which outlet to use as being right close to the floor may result in dust ending up in the various holes (electrical and USB).
Although I bought this for home use, it's small enough to bring traveling so long as the outlets where you're traveling to are the US-style and you'll have access to a philips-head screw driver (remember the screwdriver probably won't be allowed on any carry-on luggage.)

403,416,416,"Meh, it's okay.","This will cover up TWO electrical outlets, stacked vertically.  Which is the typical configuration in most American homes.  However, due to manufacturing defects sometimes the prongs on this won't line up exactly with the holes in the outlet.  Fortunately, one of the sets of prongs on this unit is FAKE, made of plastic, so you can use a razor knife and just cut them off if you have trouble making the unit fit on your outlet.

It has SIX power outlets, all grounded.  All tied to a single wall outlet.  DO NOT use this for any high-power devices or you might blow out a fuse in your house, if you connect too many high-power devices to the same outlet!  Use common sense please!  Ask an electrician if you're not sure what I mean.

The tray on top of this unit is nice for setting your cell phone down, so you can plug it into the unit to charge it up.  The unit does have some USB ports built in.  They seem to work as expected.  But the tray sticks out pretty far, be careful that it doesn't become a tripping hazard if your outlets are close to the floor.  And remember it's only meant to hold your phone.  It's not a book shelf.  Don't put a lot of weight on it.

The tray MIGHT interfere with the geometry of your plugs, too... depending how fat your device's power plugs are.  But the tray is removable if you want it out of the way.

The unit is pretty fat.  It's not a 90-degree angle on all three sides, it's not a rectangle.  The sides sort of slope, so the unit is wider at the back than at the front.  This also means that any plugs on the SIDE of the unit MIGHT interfere with trying to plug other things into the front of the unit, depending just how thick your device's plugs are.

So yeah, it's nifty for turning ONE power outlet into SIX, and the phone-charging tray is a nice touch.  But once you get it home and start plugging things in, you may find some weird problems with the basic geometry involved.  Other than that, if you have NORMAL sized device plugs, it works great.",4,B09ZKZYBZX,"This cover TWO electrical outlets, stacked vertically. Which typical configuration American homes.

442,456,456,Almost perfect,Sorry for the dark Pic. It wouldn't let me turn flash on. The only issue I have had so far is that the air button and the light button are too close to each other and are too easy to turn on on accident. You might leave the light on and not know or turn the air flow on and have to cycle through the speeds to shut off. I would give it a 4.9 if I could. So many different uses from getting the water out of the crevices when drying the dishes to getting the dust out of hard to reach areas when sanding. So many more. 👍👍,4,B0CCD7KPM6,Sorry dark Pic.

497,514,514,My  favorite LED projector by far! Ticks all the boxes.,"I bought this Nebula Capsule for a trip to South America to visit family (to show home movies and pictures). It is about the same size as a can of coke, so it is small, but boy does it pack a punch. All of the other projectors I have used were shaped like smartphones, so I was a bit thrown off by the shape of the Nebula. But let me just tell you right now, this can shape is great! I really can't say there is anything I did not like about this unit when it comes to the major features. It just ticked all the boxes. They got a lot of things right on this unit.

Things is really liked.

1. Great Speakers!
The main thing that was wrong on the other four units I have used was the speakers, which were all but useless. That is not the case with this Nebula. I showed videos to groups to over 30 people in an outdoor setting and no one had any trouble hearing clearly. Since all my previous LED projectors had basically worthless speaker, I was not expecting anything different out of this Nebula, so I bought the OontZ Angle 3 Portable Bluetooth Speaker to use with it. I did a side by side test with the OontZ Angle 3 and there is no question that built-in speakers on the Nebula are noticeably louder. Sound quality wise, they were very close. The OontZ Angle 3, I would say, had a little deeper base which might a little better for music, but the speakers on the Nebula were clearer and sharper, which is better for voice. Both speakers produced quality sound.

2. Amazing Battery Life
The thing about portable LED projectors, is that they are intended to run on battery. If you have to be hooked to AC power, why go LED in the first place? But the issue I have always had with the smartphone-shaped LED projectors is that they did not have enough battery life to play a full 2-hour movie on max brightness. Most of them top out at about 90 minutes of battery. That is not true on this Nebula. I was able to show two full-length Hollywood movies on it at max brightness and max volume with battery life to spare.

3. Good Brightness.
I am not going to say that this tiny projector can blow your 2000 Lumin Halogen full-size projector out of the water, but it has enough brightness to get the job done. I used it for three weeks showing movies nightly in South America and not once did I hear a complaint about the brightness from anyone.

4. Color Accuracy
One thing I have always had trouble with LED projectors is color accuracy. On my other units, I was always trying to mess with the settings, trying to get the color right. Not on this Nebula. The color and hue on this Nebula was spot on from the factory. I never even looked for the color settings.

5. Can be Powered with an External Battery Pack
For me, this is just a common sense MUST for a portable projector. Unfortunately, as baffling to me as it may be, there are some LED projectors that CANNOT be powered by an external battery pack (like you would use to charge your phone). Even though I never need this feature due to the over four-hour built-in battery life, it is still something I consider very important to have on a portable projector.

Things I feel could be better.

1. Only 8 GB Internal Memory
Considering that memory has gotten extremely cheap these days, I was very surprised to find that the unit only had 8 GB of internal Memory. Considering that the unit does not have a built-in SD card slot for extra memory, this was surprising, to say the least, but not a deal killer by any measure.

2. No Built-in Expandable Memory Slot.
This was another surprise to me that I did not even think about looking for because I just assumed it would have it because it is just a standard issue thing on electronics nowadays. The Nebula does have a mini-USB port (same as most Android smartphones) and comes with a USB adaptor cord that allows you to expand the memory with a USB Thumb/flash drive. Instead of using this, I chose to use the Transcend TS-RDP9K USB 2.0 OTG Card Reader, that accepts micro-SD cards, which is what I use more of. I was able to play videos from it without any issues through this port with my card reader.

3. Same Port for Expandable Memory and Charging.
If there is a real con on this device, this is it. It's not a deal breaker, but I would definitely like to see this issue addressed in newer models. Again this goes back to the small 8 GB onboard memory. Since the projector has no built-in memory card slot and uses the mini-usb charging port for expandable memory, if you run out of battery while showing a movie from a flash drive, you are dead in the water, because there is no way to power the device and play from a flash drive, since they both have to be done on the one min-usb port. So, in the event, you run out of battery and need to power the device externally, you can only play the content that is on the small 8 GB internal drive. Again, this is not a deal breaker but is clearly an engineering oversight. This problem can be easily remedied by adding an extra min-usb or a micro-SD card slot.

4. Remote Control
I am not sure if my remote control was defective or not, but it absolutely could not adjust the volume. It worked fine menu navigation, but the volume buttons gave no response. Fortunately, the projector has volume control buttons right on top of it so it was not a huge issue. There is a remote control Android app for smartphones and it does work, but like most of the remote control android apps, it is kind of janky to use.

All in all, I think this is the best mini LED projector on the market. I ended up donating my projector to a local church while in South America, but I will be buying another. For most purposes, this an all-in-one movie studio that is the size of a can of coke. Honestly, it is a flat our marvel of science. Throw this in your bag and you have everything you need for showing movies, viewing photos, videos, etc, etc. I recommend buying the very nice Nebula Capsule Official Travel Case to go with it.",5,B0CHW11C8H,"I bought Nebula Capsule trip South America visit family (to show home movies pictures).

Amazing Battery Life The thing portable LED projectors, intended run battery. If hooked AC power, go LED first place? But issue I always smartphone-shaped LED projectors enough battery life play full 2-hour movie max brightness. Most top 90 minutes battery. That true Nebula.

Can Powered External Battery Pack For me, common sense MUST portable projector. Unfortunately, baffling may be, LED projectors CANNOT powered external battery pack (like would use charge phone).

So, event, run battery need power device externally, play content small 8 GB internal drive. Again, deal breaker clearly engineering oversight. This problem easily remedied adding extra min-usb micro-SD card slot. 4. Remote Control I sure remote control defective not, absolutely could adjust volume. It worked fine menu navigation, volume buttons gave response. Fortunately, projector volume control buttons right top huge issue.

498,515,515,SO HAPPY With This-- but READ THIS FIRST!!,"I feel like a lot of the negative reviews didn't do their research before choosing a projector, and didn't bother to actually read any instructions... I spent hours comparing and contrasting projectors and finally settled on this one because of the built in apps. You *can not* airplay copyrighted content from your phone onto ANY projector (ie. Netflix/Hulu). With other, cheaper projectors, people plug in an EXTRA streaming device in order to utilize these apps. So they had to buy a projector PLUS a fire stick or roku or had to get a cable for their phone... all a lot of hubbub I didn't want to deal with. This projector has the apps built into it, so they all run from the projector alone.

A lot of people said it didn't work with iPhone and I feel like this is because they were trying to airplay content instead of using the apps on the projector itself. I actually was able to airplay from the iphone MTV app (before I found out that the projector had one to download) and the video quality was delayed a lot. So just use the built in apps. They're there for a reason.

However, using a mobile device is still required in terms of navigating through your apps. The remote control works for the projector's menu, but some apps like Hulu require you to use your phone as the remote control through the Nebula app. It basically turns your phone into a trackpad and a mouse. Easy to get the hang of. There's also a keyboard that pops up which makes it easy to search titles or input login info through your phone so you don't have to select one letter at a time. The app works fine on my iPhone 13 without any lag or connectivity issues.

**** Now here's where you really need to pay attention:**** the app comes with Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon Prime pre-loaded. Out of the box, you won't find Hulu US, Disney or HBO in the app store. Look on your main menu to see if there's an Upgrade button. If there is, go through those steps which will update the software and unlock those apps in the app store for you. If there isn't (or this doesn't work) send an email to their support asking to unlock the apps and they'll send you the instructions and a password to do so within 24 hours (seriously, they're really responsive even on weekends). Apparently they are still testing the projector's compatibility with these apps which is why it doesn't come default, but the updating process is simple (10 min) and all apps have run smoothly for me. I probably use Hulu the most out of all.

The battery life has been pretty accurate for me-- 4 hours of watching straight before I get a notice that I'm low battery and need to charge. I've gotten down to 2%, then plugged it in and kept watching and that worked as well, so it charges faster than it burns battery which is nice.

I also LOVE that there's an option to warp the projection image, which means if you have this projecting at an angle, you can adjust the picture so that it looks like it's being projected straight on and it's not stretched. We have it resting on our bed's headboard but the picture looks like it's being projected straight across the room.

As it runs, there's a pretty subtle fan sound but that usually gets drowned out by the video's audio. It can get pretty loud (though we only watch it inside, not sure how it sounds outside).

So overall, I think this is the BEST choice in projector if you don't want to deal with extra plugs, streaming devices, and you're willing to deal with the short update process even if that means emailing them. I've seriously enjoyed using it as a bedroom TV, as we had no place to put a physical TV but we had a big blank wall that works perfectly as a ""screen"" for this.",5,B0CHW11C8H,"I feel like lot negative reviews research choosing projector, bother actually read instructions...

Picture quality is superb at night (can’t use in the daytime) and the auto adjust feature is epic, point it at something from any angle and it just works, that and the android tv means as long as you have WiFi or phone hotspot you can watch whatever streaming service you have.

504,521,521,Not impressed - welcome to dongle life,"I wanted to like the Nebula Capsule projector.  I really did ... the size and the speakers are delightful. To be fair, here is what I liked

- small size
- great sound (plenty loud enough)
- able to install Amazon Prime Video and stream my movies over wifi

HOWEVER, the Nebula Capsule has a number of issues that I can't stand.  For prospective buyers, you need to be aware of these problems:

1. DIM PROJECTION --  If there is ANY ambient light, you will not be able to see the screen projected further than two feet. I can use it at night. Or in a bathroom with no windows. Or possibly camping under starlight. My kids can project onto a piece of paper a foot away.  At short range, the image looks great -- but what's the point when a tablet is the same size with better screen? I've used pico projectors years ago when they first came out, and expected the Nebula capsule to be brighter. It isn't.

2. USB DONGLE LIFE -- I bought a 32gb (Fat32) USB flash drive to play back my movie collection. Unfortunately, the device ONLY has a micro-USB port so you have to use a dongle (included) to use USB flash drives.  Now my projector has a permanent rat's tail poking off the back. This looks dumb and you can't charge the device while using the USB dongle.

3. REMOTE CONTROL REQUIRED -- This absolutely floored me.  I assumed I'd be able to control the device entirely with buttons on the projector.  Nope. You have to use the included remote control so you better not lose it. The capsule's amazing form factor becomes less impressive when you have to carry another accessory to make it work. The capsule phone app works pretty well but I'm not letting my kids have my phone just to pause their video.

4. THE ROCKER BUTTON KIND OF SUCKS -- The device has four buttons on a rocker. Volume Up, Volume Down, Power, and Bluetooth speaker mode.  If my kids try to change volume -- or hold the device the wrong way -- the rocker activates the wrong button and the unit powers down or goes into bluetooth search mode.  The children then bring the projector back to me so I can find their video or use my remote to cancel the bluetooth error message. Poor design.

5. CAN'T USE BUILT IN MEMORY -- I can't figure out how to do it.  I assumed the built-in file explorer would have a function for copying files off the USB and moving them into internal storage, but I can't find this function. I've never used android before, but I believe this is some kind of stripped down &quot;tv android.&quot;  I tried plugging the projector into my clean Windows 10 PC and the Nebula doesn't show up as a storage device. What's the point of having all that memory if you can't put videos on it? For apps, I suppose.  I tried searching for online manual or PC drivers and can't find any manuals on on anker/nebula's website. The tiny printed manual is less than helpful. I guess I'm stuck watching videos off the dongle. I'm sure you techies have some weird workaround, but people shouldn't have to jump through hoops for this function.

6. FIRMWARE  -- failed a few times. Finally downloaded completely, but the device wouldn't let me update until the battery was charged to over 50%.  It didn't matter that the device is plugged directly into the wall. This thing charges SLOW so I'm going to have to wait hours to install the firmware and see if it fixes any of these issues.  Update: it didn't.

7. LOUD FAN -- I can live with this, but this is the loudest cooling fan I've ever had on a portable electronics device under five pounds. It almost sounds like white noise. Reminds me of the fan on my old 3000-lumen Epson projector - that device was 30 times brighter and used a halogen bulb, though.

8. HARD TO ANGLE  -- the image is projected slightly upward and can't be aimed. The cylindrical shape and round footprint of the Nebula capsule make it hard to angle the device. If you slip a book under one edge, the capsule rolls over. The cube shaped projectors (like the Mars) are easier in this regard. You almost HAVE to get a tripod with this Nebula Capsule's round design.

Summary - the Nebula capsule is a neat device, especially if it had come out years ago when the first pico projectors hit the scene. The form factor is cool and the sound is especially impressive for such a small gadget.  However, the projected screen is dim and the projector requires dongles and remote controls to use properly.

The Mars seems like a better option as it is brighter (though only 500 ansi lumens), has a full-sized USB jack (no dongles), and most importantly has ALL the control buttons on top. I generally like Anker products (especially their battery packs) and wish the company much success.  However, I recommend passing on the Nebula Capsule. Mine is going back.",3,B0CHW11C8H,"I wanted like Nebula Capsule projector. I really ... size speakers delightful.

For example, I have youtube premium and we tried to watch a FREE movie that was officially from YouTubes free movie section and it refused to show the picture. We tried it on my phone and also from the app that's built in. So obviously that affects my rating. I'm sure there's some way to get around this but I have yet to look into it. Great quality tho, but I would reccomend buying the tripod for it as well as a portable speaker since the built in ones arent that great. ❤️",4,B0CHW11C8H,"We decided projector portability quiet is.

536,554,554,just like the viper mini besides DPI button,"need a mouse to surf the internet do office work and casually play games? Buy this mouse

now if you’re looking for a gaming review here you go, i was a die hard viper mini fan, i was at my highest skill level on that mouse and I swore by it to everyone who used CLAW grip, even relaxed claw. At the end of the day it’s important to remember before you buy a mouse you must know what the shape of the mouse caters to. It could be a 3 million dollar mouse and if your hand grip doesn’t work with it, it’ll be a tough time for gaming, but that doesn’t apply to Internet surfing and office work, any shape is essentially fine. Identify what your mouse grip is before you buy a mouse, and see if it is commonly liked with those with the same grip as you. This mouse is 100% for claw grip users or for people with really small hands

This mouse is not really a hybrid where other grip users can get away with using it. It is predominantly claw in my opinion

The game i play which is fortnite (sometimes valorant) got stale for a little, i got bored and decided to try a new mouse. The mouse I tried was the viper minis “closest” competitor, the HyperX Pulsefire Haste. IF YOU ARE CLAW GRIP. AND TRYING TO DECIDE BETWEEN THE VIPER MINI (COBRA PRO) AND THE PULSEFIRE HASTE , PLEASE GET THE RAZER COBRA PRO.

i would elaborate on why i dislike the hyperx mouse and the problems i had but its not important. long story short, a couple weeks ago i bit the bullet and bought the new version of the viper mini , the Razer cobra pro.

The mouse is exactly the same as the viper mini but a change in shape of the dpi button. The sensor is the same which is a common complaint but the mouse makes up for it in its click latency. just like the viper mini did. the sensor only takes a week to get used to, although i noticed a change in quality of sensor compared to the HyperX Pulsefire haste it was nothing to lose sleep over. and only took my brain a couple days to get used to the sensor. Regardless of sensor, even when i first plugged it in i was instantly better than my previous mouse.

my only complaint is the dpi button, i bind it to a keyboard bind and i use it to reload in my games. first couple of days I had trouble pressing it and i would accidentally left click/shoot. Ive gotten better with it tho, I still prefer the old dpi button but i definitely can’t complain. For claw grip there’s no other mouse like the viper mini. Ahem i mean the cobra pro ..

Quality mouse, and for a great price. G Pro Superlights break all the time, at least when you have to replace your Razer mouse it’s only 40 dollars. If you’re smacking your mouse around all the time playing Fortnite all mouses are bound to break at some point. If this shape works for you it will definitely save you money in the long run when the inevitable mouse break happens and you have to get a new one. I could see this mouse actually lasting forever if someone was using it for less abrupt mouse movements like valorant , counter strike, Minecraft, etc. though

Worried about the cord? Make the jump and order a mouse bungee too if you don’t already have one. Youre already here on amazon. It is a neccessity, no negotiation. Dont make things hard for yourself, if you get a wired mouse, order a mouse bungee and all will be fine.

Im not even a big Razer buff, all my other equipment are different brands. but this mouse is a quality mouse for its price and holds up against the best of the best. seriously, this was a long time ago and im sure it’s different now but they did a test and the viper mini was top 5 among mouses like FinalMouse. Ive tried plenty of mice and for claw grip this is absolutely without a doubt my favorite.

537,555,555,The Best Budget Claw/Fingertip Mouse.,"I consider my self somewhat of a gaming mouse enthusiast. I currently have 6 mice that stay on my desk.
Viper V2 Pro, Deathadder V3 Pro, GPX SuperLight 1, G703, G305 and now the Cobra. Only one of which is my main ( Viper V2 Pro ) But I like to switch between them. I'm more a collector now than anything. I have tons of other mice in the drawer. Knowing I have had my hands on these more expensive mice I can give honest unbiased thoughts on the Cobra. 40$ after tax in my opinion is an absolute steal. Yes even for a wired mouse these days. They could easily charge $60-$70 for this mouse. It comes with a modified version of Razers top optical sensor ( which is just a modified 3395 ) and I have had zero of the issues people stated early on after this mouse released like ""spin out"" and LOD issues. Cobra has performed flawlessly so far. I will come back and update this review if any issues arise. One huge plus is the Cobra/Cobra Pro comes with Razers optical switches. Which means no need to worry about double clicking. The mouse 1 & 2 are loud though. Just like the rest of Razers line up of mice. The clicks themselves feel great. Little bit on the mushy side though. Wish they were a tad bit more snappy. But they are still great. No issues. The side thumb buttons are absolutely perfect. I am an absolute thumb button snob because I actually use them a lot. They are very snappy and not mushy at all. These make the GPX SuperLight feel cheap. The skates ( mouse feet ) and very good as well. No need to upgrade them to aftermarket skates because they perform very well out the box. If you have large hands I wouldn't recommend this mouse. My hands are 19.5cmx10.5cm and this mouse is a tad bit small for me but luckily I'm a claw gripper. Would have liked to see some included grip tape, not a huge deal though since it is only $40. It's also light weight at 58 grams. All in all, it's a fantastic buy. Definitely recommend at least giving it a try!

538,556,556,Excellent all-rounder mouse,"This review is for the Razer Cobra Pro (wireless ver). Razer built a feature rich mouse that can do it all with excellent build quality (no creaking, side flexing or M1/M2 wobble) compared to the mice from other brands.

A lot of critics wanted an ultra lightweight ~50g Viper mini, not this. But for the people who care about having a feature rich mouse with excellent build quality, ability to cycle between multiple devices using different connections (Bluetooth, 2.4GHz wireless, wired), this is a great mouse that also happens to have the latest and greatest tech for top tier gaming performance. There's a profile button on the bottom of the mouse that allows you to cycle between different profiles, which is useful if you wanted to have a profile for your laptop that turns off the RBG lighting, reduces the poll rate to 500 Hz (save battery) etc.

The mouse has on-board memory, so you can save your profiles and settings, then uninstall Synapse if you so please. The only con is that the RGB settings are still not saved with the on-board memory profiles (c'mon Razer). The M1/M2 buttons have a crisp, slightly higher than normal audible click and the side buttons are placed well and feel great. The rubber side grips are molded into this model, so you cannot remove them. This is not great if they wear down, as they cannot be easily replaced like grip tape. The shape of the mouse is 99% the exact same as it's predecessor, the Viper mini.

From a technical perspective, this mouse is capable of 4K Hz polling rate, but only if you purchase the HyperPolling dongle or the Dock Pro from Razer, otherwise it defaults to 1K Hz polling. The mouse is not as heavy as everyone is lamenting online, as it weighs in at ~76g. If you take off the dongle cover on the Razer Cobra Pro, you can get the mouse down to ~74g and which improves the balance in my opinion. For reference, here is how much some popular mice weigh among the big two:
- Logitech G305 which is similar in size, weighs 99g.
- G Pro Wireless is 80g
- G Pro SuperLight is 61g
- Razer Viper Ultimate is 74g
- Razer Viper V2 Pro is 59g

Battery life:
- 170 hours on Bluetooth
- 100 hours on 2.4GHz wireless (1K Hz polling)
- 33 hours on 2.4 GHz wireless (4K Hz polling)

Overall, I really like this mouse from Razer and personally, going up in weight from ~50g hasn't had any impact on gaming performance, I adjusted very quickly and actually don't mind the extra bit of weight (high sens). In the future, a lighter V2 with no rubber side grips would be ideal.

--TLDR--
Pros:
- Excellent build quality (no creaking, flexing or M1/M2 wobble)
- Top tier sensor from Razer
- Multi-device capable (Bluetooth to your laptop, 2.4GHz dongle in your desktop. even wired)
- Gen 3 Razer optical switches (no double clicking like mechanical switches)
- Mouse wheel is rubberized, feels great
- Medium weight mouse at ~76g (74g if you remove the dongle cover)
- USB-C connector
- Top tier 2.4GHz almost zero latency wireless connection

Cons:
- Built-in rubber side grips (if these wear down, you're stuck with it instead of just replacing grip tape)
- RGB settings aren't stored in the on-board memory, so you'll have to keep Synapse installed if you care about specific RGB settings
- 4K Hz polling rate requires the additional HyperPolling dongle or Dock Pro (sold separately)
- could be lighter (~60g range), but not a deal breaker

Bonus review:
The wired version of the Cobra is almost an exact replica of the Viper Mini wired, but with improvements to the sensor for LOD (lift off distance) and now has the Gen3 optical switches.

Battery life is something i cant talk much on sense ive only had it for a day, but will update on it when i get more playtime with it.
Performance wise, cant beat it, ive had other razer mice that were okay, and typically wouldnt beat a $50 HyperX mouse, but with this mouse u can actually feel the difference and it actually has helped me improve just off of a couple hours of playtime.
Now my main thing that i dislike, is thr weight. Its not heavy, but ive been using a 59g mouse for a bit now and the difference is noticeable in games that need precision like valorant, cs, or OW.

543,561,561,"Honestly, lighter isn’t better.","This was my second attempt at the new ambidextrous mice Razer has been working on. I’ve been running a Lancehead since 2019 which has been awesome, and a Diamondback before that. The Diamondback eventually became prey to the scroll wheel jitter issue, but I liked it nonetheless. The viper and now cobra in my opinion are honestly too light. I get what Razer was going for, but it makes them feel really cheap and honestly I find myself not being able to get good tracking because I’m actually picking it up off the desk slightly due to the reduced weight. It has a loud hollow click unlike previous mice and it also isn’t flat on the bottom across the entire footprint, so it will actually wobble side to side pretty easily. I’m left-handed so I hit a bit of a snag on finding good gaming mice because they're often formed for the right hand. I wish Razer would make a full-feature, left-handed edition of the Deathadder. Razer continues to keep that mouse current because of it’s popularity, so I see no reason why they can’t mirror everything about it and make a left-handed edition. But that’s just me.

545,563,563,One of Razer's most beautiful products to date... possibly the worst battery ever,"I love mostly everything about this mouse but the battery. It feels nice in the hand, the RGB is BEAUTIFUL, and it glides across my mouse pad. The buttons are very tactile and responsive as well. BUT.. the battery life is just the worst. Razer claims the battery life lasts up to 100 hours on hyperspeed and up to 170 hours on Bluetooth. That is an absolute lie. I also use this mouse for work and it barely last a day and a half before it starts blinking red. That's about 14 hours of continuous use before I have to charge it again. I have even used battery saving measures like turning down the RGB brightness to 25%, setting the mouse to power off after 3 minutes of inactivity, and even switching to bluetooth but nothing works. I have had to resort to switching the Razer Chroma RGB off completely to extend the battery life and I still only get maybe 24 hours of use before it's dead again, and that's even with turning it off after each use. That's a shame because this is most beautiful RGB product Razer has put out to date and the battery just renders it useless.

As a kid I had a rocks and Minerals book and I would sit for hours and reading through it, looking at all the close up pictures.  I'd , mentally take journeys to the rocks native location and imagining how they were created over time, the chemical composition and bonds that formed the shapes and absolutely enjoyed those adventures over TV.

Fast forward and now I have a new book that fits more into my other hobby, Electronics.  The book shows  clear and detailed explanations with pictures of components I have used many times over the years, even the older versions.  The cut away view of each component shows the internal connections or materials and how they are made is really fascinating to see.  The pictures even show the inner workings of some of the more advances yet common components used in every day electronics.  Well worth the read.  For sure to offer a young person that final spark to make a choice into a long term career path.  Would recommend getting one for a office waiting room,  a  coffee table as a conversation piece,  or one just to have in that how does it work collection of books.  So happy I purchased this book.

My cats even like to curl up and read the book with me but I suspect it's for other reasons...  Amazon packed the book to me un-wrapped and without a protective bag in a box with two 15lbs bags of cat food.  By the time I received the order the book corners had ripped open one of the bags of cat food and the food was smashed all over the box leaving a oil residue on the book.  Luckily the oil was thin and wiped off the face of the book relatively easily.  The corners of the book received some rounding and have minor damage but nothing that regular use over time would also produce.

559,577,577,Sorta streak free? But excellent use,"TLDR at the bottom
----
Using cleaners on computer monitors is a gamble, or requires lots of research to see what is safe. And when my 2 monitors are over $300 each, I want to be certain I'm using a safe cleaner.

I have attempted to use plain old 70% alcohol pads but it left quite some noticeable streaks. So I ordered these wipes instead. Now I have to use around 2-3 per monitor to actually get it mostly streak free, but the few streaks left over are not very visible. That's the main reason I gave it 4 stars. Does the monitor look brand new afterwards? Not for me, it looks like it was slightly cleaned. But again, not too noticeable and the ""dirt"" is washed away.

The packaging is surprisingly firm and solid, and the re-sealable flap is very sturdy and sticky. The wipes are tightly packed, and difficult to rip apart. Some people complained about the moistness level of the wipes, but mine seem to be normal or actually slightly on the drier side. Overall, it's nothing that compromises its use or else I would have returned it and written a review with much less stars.

It does cost around $5-6, and it around 20 cents a wipe, but these wipes are not going to be used all the time like your regular household cleaners. My monitor needs regular cleaning MAYBE once a month, if even that. So in the end, a pack can last you easily over half a year before needing to be reordered. Because of this, I think the value of it is great!

TLDR: Not fully streak free for me, needed to use 2-3 wipes per monitor to achieve satisfactory results. Fantastic and high quality packaging.

561,579,579,Cleanliness is next to geekiness: The secret to pristine electronics and truly invisible glass,"When it comes to cleaning my electronics, there's one product that I always trust to do the job right: Windex Electronics Wipes. These wipes are an absolute game-changer for anyone who wants their electronics to look their best. They come in a resealable pack and each wipe is perfectly moist enough to do its job without leaving any residue or streaks. I keep them on hand at all times, especially since my computer has a huge tempered glass side that's always front and center in my living room. It is also always eye level with me when I'm sitting infront of my computer so I'll notice dust and fingerprints immediately.

The tempered glass side of my computer is a major focal point in my room, and I'm always looking for ways to make it look its best. That's where Windex Electronics Wipes come in - they do an amazing job of turning the tempered glass invisible. I can't tell you how many times family members have tried to point out something inside the case and ended up jamming their fingers into the glass because they couldn't tell it was there. It really does give the illusion that the side of the computer is off.

I also use these wipes to clean my LCD monitors, which can get dusty from time to time. They work like a charm and leave my monitors looking crystal clear. In fact, I even use them to clean my tablets and cell phone screens, as well as a decorative crystal prism that I have. They work amazingly well for all of these applications.

In addition to the incredible job that the Windex Electronics Wipes do in cleaning and making glass invisible, it's worth noting that I also use a microfiber cloth to polish the surface after using the wipes. This helps to remove any lingering fingerprints or dust particles that may have been missed during the initial cleaning, as well pick up any left over Windex chemicals on the glass.

I find that the combination of the Windex wipes and the microfiber cloth really does wonders for making my electronics look brand new again. And with the tempered glass side of my computer being such a focal point in my living room, it's important to me that it looks as clean and polished as possible.

Overall, I highly recommend the Windex Electronics Wipes for anyone looking for a quick and easy solution to clean and polish their electronics. The wipes are perfectly moistened, come sealed in a resealable pack, and are incredibly effective at removing dust, dirt, and fingerprints. Plus, when paired with a microfiber cloth, they leave my electronics looking like they just came out of the box.

One thing to note, however, is that you should never use these wipes on OLED or newer televisions. These types of screens can be damaged by chemicals, so it's best to stick to a microfiber polishing cloth and maybe a small amount of deionized water on the microfiber if you need to clean something off a screen.

I highly recommend giving Windex Electronics Wipes a try. They're easy to use, safe, effective, and always leave my screens looking new and my tempered glass sided RGB Dream Machine invisible.

567,585,585,A well deserved best seller. Excellent!,"As other reviewer has noted the authors have made a very concientious effort to try to be clear and practical. This is not a theoretical book, although chapter 2 &#34;Theory&#34; alone may well be worth the price for book. Chapter 2 is the most difficult, extensive and theoretical chapter in the book, but worth the effort. The explanations are very detailed and organized on different levels of difficulty. The authors are very systematic in their approach. All basic RC / LC / RLC circuits are explained by calculus, by mechanical / hydraulical analogues and the behaviour is summarized in tables at the end of each section. The authors make a consistent effort to make sure the reader grasps the essentials.

Whether the mathematics used in Chapter 2 is difficult or easy depends on the reader's prior background. Some knowledge of basic calculus helps, but is not an absolute requirement, as the solution of the equations is given and rather extensively explained by other means. Complex variables are also used, but the mechanics of complex variables calculations are explained clearly, simply and with enough worked examples and exercises to allow a dedicated reader to be able to learn how to get practical results without getting into the technical details.

After chapter 2 the book gets very practical indeed, with detailed coverage of the elements of circuits (chapter 3). This chapter in particular is extremely well written The elements of circuits, from connectors to wires, to the different constructions, advantages, applications and disadvantages of different types of capacitors, resistors, inductors, batteries, connectors and even wires are explained at length.

Transistors, Op Amps and Discrete Logic circuits are covered in the following chapters. An overview of microcontrollers and FPGAs is included but is not as deep, so if your interest is specifically in these you will have to expand with another book. Test equipment, oscilloscope and multimeter principles and use, pcb construction, recommndations on building your electronic component stockpile.... This book has almost everything I can think a beginner would need.

While the book is not hardcover and somewhat floppy, it is sturdy enough to withstand heavy use. My volume is certainly not falling apart. T printing is black and white only, but the drawings and diagrams are very legible and clear. The paper quality used is a bit uneven throughout, with a few pages here and there printed on what seems more porous paper, but all perfectly legible.

Some mistakes have made it to the fourth edition.
1. On pages 182 and 184 the title of the section should be &#34;LCR circuit&#34; instead of &#34;LC circuit&#34;
2. On page 302 section 3.5.2 the denominator of the expression in the example should be 1000 + 3000 ohms, instead of 1000 x 3000 ohms. The result is correctly stated as 4000 ohms.

A well deserved best seller. If you know nothing about electronics it will get you to a very decent level of understanding. If you already know about electronics the explanations, tables, and detailed descriptions are very useful. It has a much gentler learning curve than the other classic book with a practical orientation &#34;The Art of Electronics&#34; by Horowitz, buy both if you can, but &#34;Practical Electronics&#34; is an excellent place to start.",5,1259587541,"As reviewer noted authors made concientious effort try clear practical.

I read the description for the book, and it seemed to fit the bill, so I put it on pre-order and waited. It arrived around a week ago, and thus far it seems to be everything I was looking for, and more. If you don't want to sit through the rest of my review, I'll summarize by saying that this book is well worth the price. It is a big book, and covers a wide variety of topics in circuit analysis and design, from basic theory to electric motors to audio electronics. Each chapter includes an overview of the theory and big ideas of the subject, plus practical information for those looking to implement the ideas. I certainly was not disappointed.

As I mentioned, this is a large book, checking in at nearly 1000 pages. &#34;You could hurt someone with it,&#34; as my old literature teacher used to say. It may weigh heavy on the scale, but is light on your wallet, in the $20-$30 range for a new copy. Another reviewer has pointed out that the low price is partially enabled by printing on rather low-quality paper. This is true; the paper is not of particularly great quality, but in my opinion this does not detract from the book's worth. By no means is the book in danger of falling apart, so I would not let this minor issue deter you from picking up a copy.

Now, regarding the content: this book is broken up into 16 chapters, or 17 if you count the three or four-page first chapter. The first &#34;real&#34; chapter is truly colossal, and fills almost 250 pages with the theory of electronic circuits. This alone is worth the price of admission. This is followed by another large chapter that deals with the basic components that are used in circuits everywhere, and includes many useful tables, diagrams, and sketches of almost every variation of the components imaginable (for example, the chapter describes 8 different styles of switches). From here, the book branches out into several areas of circuits. You can continue through the chapters in order, to learn about semiconductors, optoelectronics, and sensors; or you could jump ahead to chapter 12 to start on digital electronics, then continue to microcontrollers and programmable logic. In general, each chapter starts with a basic introduction to the topic, followed by subsections that dig deeper into the specifics. If there is anything to complain about structurally, it would be the rather odd placement of &#34;hands on electronics,&#34; which is chapter number 7. The chapter itself focuses on the physical construction of circuits, including safety, diagrams, breadboards, and other lab equipment such as multimeters and power supplies. Given the content of the chapter, I feel that it would have made more sense to place it after the chapter on basic components, rather than wedged between sensors and op-amps. However, I certainly prefer to have the information in a strange location than not at all.

All in all, this is an excellent reference for someone who wants a one-stop shop to review any of the wide variety of topics that are covered. This book does seem to be more focused on breadth of topics than depth, so it may be more useful to hobbyists than professionals. In either case, the book should be a valuable pickup for anyone in search of a solid overview of electronic circuits.",5,1259587541,"Having taken several Electrical Engineering courses part Software Engineering degree, developed keen interest embedded systems, I wanted pick book reference designing building circuits.

572,591,591,And It Just Keeps Getting Better!!,"I have been using this book to teach a university introductory electronics class for several years, starting with the second edition, through the third edition, and will now start using the Fourth Edition this fall. It is an excellent book at an excellent price.  The real value of this book, as I shared with my previous reviews, is the breadth of information that is covered.  This is a book that should be on the shelf of any engineer who will ever have to deal with any question of electricity or electronics.  Does it cover every topic in exhaustive detail?  No, and that is part of its strength.  It gives enough information for the novice to get the concept along with ways to find more information.  A new chapter has been added on programmable logic, which continues to grow more day by day.

In addition to the traditional material on electricity concepts such as voltage, current, and resistance, there is a lot of useful day-to-day information.  There is a section on electric motors, a section on home electrical wiring, a section on electrical safety, and lots more.  There is a chapter on sensors that is more up to date with the recent advances in less expensive modules that can be used by microcontrollers like the Arduino.  Again, no exhaustive detail, but the information is present to spur the reader on to find more detailed information on the internet and in other references.

Thankfully, this book is NOT written like a traditional textbook with lots of theories and derivations of equations.  It presents what you need to work with electricity and with electronic components.  It's a tutor...it gives you the basics so that you then know how to find the information when needed.  At over 1000 pages, there's a high probability that any topic the reader wants to know about is at least mentioned along with the means to find further information.

573,592,592,Fantastic - a few issues,"So far, the Theory chapter looks like a lowpass filter for 4 years spent studying EE.  Filters out the noise and stuff I haven’t needed in the workplace.  Also covers the physics behind the concepts to exactly the extent needed to understand the head scratchers - without the equations.

So far, here are some issues (I’ll have to update).
Fig 2.13: technically some of these voltages are negative.  Fig 2.14 Should have come first.  Then an explanation that Vab = Va- Vb.

A Canadian mentioned that neutral and ground bar are connected at the mains and shouldn’t be.  I guess this would be Fig 2.29. So I did some googling.  Looks like in the US, ground and neutral bars are connected at the mains only, but not at sub panels. So the figure is fine.

Fig 2.35e. Loads using a bus bar for return. As the authors explain on the next page, this method is for bread boarding ICs where each IC is a load. But they really should emphasize that this should not to be done elsewhere.  For example if you have a rack of equipment, each piece of equipment is considered a load; the bus bar should most definitely not be used for return current. Here, d. works. If ICs make up a circuit board that’s relatively complex, again, d. where the loads are now individual circuit boards.  In short, e. should not be used for anything beyond breadboarding ICs.

574,593,593,The only book on electronics you will need.,"This is probably the only book on electronics that you need. Really you could probably learn all of this on the web, but this puts a summary of everything all in one place. In some sense it's like an electronics textbook, but it's better than that because it's much more howto-oriented. And for $20 or so it's an amazing deal.

My main complaint is that the chapter on theory is a bit weak in making the math comprehensible. The main problem there is that in some places a new formula is introduced that uses a variable such as Q but Q is never defined. If I were writing this then I would create a callout box every time a new formula was mentioned that clearly spelled out what each variable is even if it seems redundant. For example: &#34;Ohm's Law: V=IR. V=Voltage (Electromotive Force) in Volts, I=Current In Amps, R=Resistance in Ohms. I depends on V and R.&#34; And do that for every single one. This would make it much more useful for reference when you need to look up a formula and can't remember what Q is supposed to mean.

But the main point of this book is the non-theoretical information that it provides. For example, the real world models of various components like capacitors and wires and how they look in schematic form when stray inductance and leakage current resistance are added. Also, the chapter which is almost like a rewrite of the theory chapter but with most of the theory replaced with the details of various types of real world components that you usually don't think about (such as different resistor and capacitor technologies) is extremely useful. Most of these little details tend to get left out of things like textbooks, perhaps based on the thinking that they're too irrelevant.

Though I wish some of the math stuff had been handled better, anyone trying to build electronics in the real world should buy this book. After buying this I really don't feel like I need any other book.

Lastly, some reviewers mentioned the thin paper. I didn't find that to be a problem. I used to buy some &#34;low cost developing world editions&#34; of books that were printed on paper not much better than newsprint and this book has much better material quality for not much more money than a comparable low cost developing world edition of a textbook.",5,1259587541,"This probably book electronics need.

Additionally, many of the other kits and courses force your to learn Arduios, which I am not against at a future date, but for right now, I want to understand the basics of schematics and working with breadboards. I want to learn the components, what they do and how to plan to use them. I want instruction using a basic multi-meter. Happy to learn about Arduino's later. Just not what I am still wrapping my mind around the basics.

Determined, I decided to just start buying all of the beginner books out there until I found an instructor whose style resonated with me. THIS IS THE BOOK! Just WOW! Such clarity and simplicity to understand. Charles Platt clearly understands how to take a complex subject matter and make it palpable for a beginner like me. That is also not to say his understanding is surface level, he has a very DEEP understanding of electronics and has many additional books on the subject.

Suffice it to say, I study his book EVERY MORNING now and am LOVING it. There are some things I need to re-read, but I definitely am having much more success with Make:Electronics 3rd Edition. (Always get the latest editions!)

Also, there is an electronics component kit that comes with this book. I highly, HIGHLY recommend getting this kit as well, so you can physically create the breadboards and learn hands on as you go. You will be at a huge learning disadvantage if you do not do these experiments.

Thank you Charles Platt! As a teacher myself, I appreciate the effort you have taken to make this difficult subject matter so accessible- I appreciate you!",5,1680456873,"For many years I interested learning electronics, I purchased feels like dozen different books, kits online courses.

I obviously do have a background in electricity but I feel he explains it very well for someone who does not, it may not be a good book for someone under the age of 12 though. Anyways I ordered it after being curious of the components in the kit I had made, very glad that I did because I ended up reading the book in two days, then ordered the this third edition as soon as it came out. Everything is extremely well explained, also with some interesting history of things mixed in. I felt most of the projects were useful and made most of them myself. After this book showed me the things I could actually do (never thought it was in my ability to make electronics) I have been doing a lot of little projects for myself and learned about Arduino (which is also talked about in the book). Bottom line: If you are interested in making (or modifying) electronics this is the best book I have read to get going on it (I have got other books since that seem to focus too much on the math to get someone interested).",5,1680456873,"I ordered book buying ""build digital clock kit"" I wanted practice soldering (I electrician one skill I never tackled).

599,618,618,Great beginners book BUT...,"This has been a great way to get into electronics for me. I have pretty close to 0 background and so I wanted to start from the absolute beginning, and this book has been excellent for that. BUT, a word of caution. I will say that if you want to follow along exactly with this book, you should get the book first, and then buy one of the two kits from different companies that has the specific parts the author is talking about. They are listed in the back of the book. I purchased a kit before this book that has probably 70% of the parts he uses, but some resistors are rated slightly differently than what he uses for instance, and if you truly are starting from the beginning like I was, then all of the sudden I'm trying not only to learn what the author is saying, but also worrying about whether or not something will work because I have the wrong part or if it's because I did something wrong. That being said, at the end of the book there is an appendix so you can buy individual parts which is what I'm looking at, but in hindsight, even though the kits aren't cheap, it would have been so much easier and probably not much more expensive to just buy the kits pre-made. So, in summation, I recommend the book, but I wish I would have also bought the kit the author recommends. If you don't have that kit, you won't be able to dive right in and it'll take some extra research and extra time to get the parts to really get into the book and follow along exactly.",5,1680456873,"This great way get electronics me.

605,624,624,Awesome product with minor flaw,"This product is awesome but has a flaw (in my personal opinion). I'll start with the good:

Pros:
- The size of this product makes it incredibly useful and convenient. It doesn't take up too much space, but is big enough so it won't get lost amongst your clutter and junk.
- The bluetooth capabilities on this device are amazing. Most products of this nature have wonky bluetooth that connects only sometimes and doesn't hold a stable connection, however both the pairing and connection to bluetooth foe thus product is extremely stable and easy.
- More on technology, this thing prints fast and the quality of the output is very good. The app is works great and allows a lot of freedom to really costume the label however you'd like. You need a vip account to use certain icons but the app is pretty awesome and allows for you to use custom images so you can easily bypass this by finding photos of something you may want to print and then uploading it on the app. This product is well built, but functions well and is worth the money because the app is just as amazing as it offers the user so much opportunity to explore their creativity.
- No ink needed! This makes it extremely easy to use. You only need the specified rolls of labels which this bundle provides you one.

Now onto the cons:
- What didn't work for me with this label maker was personal issues that may not apply to everyone. The first one is that the labels are too small. The labels (by my rough estimates) are only about 1.5x0.5in. That's extremely small and really only useful for labeling small items. For my use and need, it just won't work efficiently (to be fair though, this product is classified as their small size, so it may have been wishful thinking to believe this would print larger).
- The second flaw foe me is that it only prints in black and white. This isn't a deal breaker, and it's even listed in the description before purchasing, but it would have been nice if it could print in color. If it did, I think it would make up for the small label sizes.

Overall, I bought this small label maker for only ~$12 after using a %15 discount code. For the money and what it can do, it's definitely worth it. But if the labels are too small for you needs, you may want to look elsewhere for something that can print larger.",5,B0CNBR3KV3,"This product awesome flaw (in personal opinion).

630,651,651,Love these lighters,"Great Gifts:
I have bought these lighters for multiple friends and family members. They come in many different colors which makes it easy to give as a gift to almost anyone. They're about the width of a typical marker and as long as a pencil/pen so it is easy to store when not in use. Perfect for stocking stuffers at Christmas or a fun gift for birthdays, etc.

Battery Life:
They hold their charge for months on end (I bought mine in months ago and it is still working off of its first charge in March). Charging only takes a short time, which is helpful when you first buy it and just can't wait to try it out.

Usage:
I have used mine to light candles and it is so easy. Unlike traditional lighters, you never run out of fuel and you don't have to get a new lighter every few months/years.

Waste:
For those that care about plastic waste, these are an easy solution. It's an easy way to stop buying typical lighters that use plastic. They charge quickly using electricity and last for a long time.

Safety features:
Because of its length, it is almost impossible to get burned, unlike matches that burn quickly to your fingertips. There's also a button at the bottom of the lighter that you have to push before pressing the button that turns on the lighting aspect so there are no accidental fires being started.",5,B07D6LX9ZP,"Great Gifts: I bought lighters multiple friends family members.

641,664,664,Good card adapter support all device and cycle motors,"Great for my Mitsubishi evo , which has an outdated display panel, no touch screen, and hard to use controls. This CarPlay device exceeded my expectations. It’s very easy to set up. Auto connection is fast within seconds. Connection is stable without any interruption during use. Thank to the compact design, I can put it inside the storage box / compartment between the two front seats because there are USB ports inside, so it’s invisible in the car this is very nice. Now I can control from my iPhone and everything is much easier. The latency does exist but is minimal, and it's just a minor problem comparing with the overall performance. It’s a big improvement from the old display and I would recommend it to any friends who need to upgrade the display system.
Customers like the appearance, performance, size and ease of use of the wireless audio adapter. For example, they mention it's sleek, modern and fits any car. They appreciate the connectivity, saying it connects quickly and automatically. Some are happy with the value. That said, opinions are mixed on quality.
So this wireless CarPlay dongle works great for me. I have a evo car & iPhone 13 pro. It connected easily and seamlessly to my car and phone and works perfectly. No lag time or loss of sound quality. I really love that my phone has a mag charger and my car has a mag charger but to use my CarPlay I still had to plug in my phone. This dongle connects my phone to my car wirelessly so I don't even have to pull it out of my purse. It also supports multiple devices and has an easily navigatiable selection page. My hubby can I can both use it & switching back & forth is easy. It seems like such a little thing but to not have to dig out my phone and hard wire plug it into my car just makes me so happy.
If your vehicle only uses a wired connection for Carplay (such as our 2018 Atlas) this is a great option for going wireless. Once you set it up (which is very easy), it just works. Each time the car turns on, it automatically detects your phone and starts playing. No need to remove your phone or do any setup each time.
An astute user may notice that there can be a slight delay at times between the button press and the screen response. However, I don't mark off from the score for this, because a little lag is expected given the amount of data being transferred between the adapter and phone.
Moving from wired to wireless Carplay is a game changer in the car! The card card works just as advertised and set up was a breeze and connected to different iPhones on the first attempt. As others have stated, it has low latency and responds as fast as a factory wireless Carplay in my opinion after having both. I did notice the unit continuing to pull power or atleast blinking blue when the vehicle was off and locked, which makes me nervous for eventual battery drain but so far so good after a couple weeks in.
This is a excellent charger, it can fast charge 2 devices at the same time. The main body is a sort of brushed aluminium which gives it quality feel, the top is plastic, as with all others out there. Really like the way the top is lit up with a blue light around the rim, it as also shows you the current power output in Volts via a little digital display. Having this display does make the top of the device a little bigger than others I've had, but not an issue for me. For the price I think this is powerful and well made and I personally like the fact it lights up (matches the ambient light in my car)
Works great. You have to connect Bluetooth to use your apple carplay. YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, Disney Plus all work! And your passenger can watch as you’re driving. Great for the kids on road trips. Keep in mind you need hotspot from your phone or separate device so you can use those media apps. Personally have a WiFi box in my F150. Highly recommend this if you want to do away with wires and get more features!!
I've had a couple of these wireless CarPlay adapters, and they're usually pretty janky. This one was no exception until I was able to get the firmware updated. Once I did the firmware update procedure it connects to the phone and the car stereo every time the car starts.
I especially like that there's a permanently attached cable, because that saves space over a cable in a socket. In my case, the cable is just long enough to put the device in a little cutout in the dash and have the cord run over to the USB jack. The cord is very flexible as well, so it lays still. If you're spacing is different, maybe you'd want a detachable cable to replace with something longer.
One caveat: The device I got looks different than the pictured device, so if they're now selling a completely different model (and not just the same electronics in a new case), this review doesn't really apply.",5,B0CQ2FJS6T,"Great Mitsubishi evo , outdated display panel, touch screen, hard use controls.

643,666,666,Stellar performance!,"In this day and age, with all the advancements in technology, why do some auto manufacturers build cars that don’t link wirelessly to Apple CarPlay? Grrrrrr!!! FRUSTRATING!
My two most recent cars were reliant upon a wired connection to connect with CarPlay and it was often difficult and sometimes even dangerous to deal with. Over a year ago, I started looking at available adapters that provided connectivity, but the reviews on most of them were pretty bad. However, recently I read some great reviews for CarPlay Wireless Adapter and users were seemingly happy with the results, so I rolled the dice and ordered one.
After two months of using the adapter I am not happy with it. I am OVERWHELMINGLY THRILLED BEYOND BELIEF with it! The performance of the adapter with Google Maps is seamless and trouble free. Connecting to Spotify takes maybe two seconds and after that, it is seamless as well. Since I don’t listen to music or podcasts much, this is not an issue for me. If I did listen to music, I think I’d just play the Eagle’s Peaceful Easy Feeling when I’m driving, because that’s what the adapter has given me! Okay, so maybe that’s a stretch, but you get the point.
I recommend the adapter to my granddaughter and she is thrilled as well. If you’re on the fence about purchasing an adapter, find comfort in my review.

709,734,734,Decent Kit for the Money,"Purchased the 142 piece kit because I needed something to work on a range of electronics around the house, from a new PC build to upgrading a couple older MacBook Pro notebooks and taking an Aiwa home stereo apart. The lineup of bits is comprehensive, and I found myself appreciating the little extra tools like the spudgers and tweezers on more than one occasion. Everything included seemed to be durable enough for what it was designed for and should last quite some while.
I have not seen any of the bits showing signs of rusting, so that is a plus. Usually those are the first things you'll see exhibiting corrosion in the cheaply-made kits.

The included driver with the extendable neck was a little finicky when I first began using it - the spinning end-cap was pretty stubborn, and it didn't freely rotate until after I used the tool for a while. It works nicely now, so I can't complain. With a price just under $30 dollars, I'd say it's a decent buy for an electronics kit that can tackle most projects you throw at it. Having used it for at least six jobs myself, it has held up well for what I needed it for.

I only wish they had included a second driver of the same type in kits like these, because you'll often be working with a second type / size of screw during a take-down or reassembly and having to switch out bits every time you need to go back and forth gets a bit annoying.

713,738,738,A few things to consider…,"This set is pretty comprehensive, which I really like. Unfortunately, the screwdriver portion feels cheap. Not only is it plastic, but the rubber grip, which btw is a nice addition, doesn’t go all the way around. My biggest issue with this set is that the chuck diameter is too large to get into recessed screw holes. So while It’s great that the screwdriver extends and there is an additional semi-flexible extension, the chuck being too large renders the other features unhelpful to me. I’ve run into this issue three times disassembling various electronics (a job site fan, an M18 battery, and a kids electronic toy). And while you can use the 4.0 star socket to get another 11/16” extension, the bit is no longer magnetized at that point and will therefore fall out of the socket. The two bits I’ve tried  on surface screws worked well and I didn’t experience any slippage in the bit, shaft, or handle . Having a magnetic head is definitely helpful when dealing with electronics.

**Update** After going 0/4 with recessed screws (because the chuck is so large), I decided to return this set. For what I do I require a chuck that can get to recessed screws; however, this is a good set if you’re only removing surface screws.",4,B08SGM6F79,"This set pretty comprehensive, I really like.

717,742,742,All around solid kit with one major downside.,"This is a large kit with many bits, tools, and other accessories that come in handy when repairing small electronics. The bits are hard and won’t strip easily. The plastic pry tools are tough and very well suited for disassembly. All of the other accessories are well made and work great for their intended purposes.

The one major downside to this set is the connector for the handle to the bit and/or the length of the bits themselves. The part that is connects the handle to the bits is is pretty large around where the bits fit in and the bits themselves are rather short. So if you need to access deeply set screws then you are kind of SOL with this kit.

The only way to try and get to those kind of deeply set screws with this kit is to stuff some sort of filler into the bottom of the connector so that the bit doesn’t go all the way down. This will cause the bit to not stay in place magnetically so they will fall out if there is no pressure on them.

If you don’t have any deep set screws then this is not an issue but if you do you might need to purchase a single driver for those screws or try the work around that I mention for this kit.

729,756,756,"Fairly Complete, Fairly Essential","A very good introduction to the fundamental concepts and (discrete) devices used in modern electronic practice.  If you want a ""hands-on"" experience, and are willing to put in the time, this book (structured in modules that walk you through practical examples of how devices and basic circuits work) could be a good choice.

I note the criticisms by other reviewers, and don't disagree with them.  I've been less than completely satisfied by the format (as noted elsewhere, ""backwards"" Q-&-A ordering), and sometimes the explanations are skimpy.

I'm still ""in progress"" with this one, so will reserve further judgment for later.

Despite those shortcomings, this self-paced, self-teaching program really does have a lot to offer the beginner.

NOTE that if you do all the exercises in this book, it could be costly, depending on how well-supplied your workshop is right now.

Obviously, if you don't have a particular item, you can forego the exercise, but for maximum return, it's clearly best to have all of these gadgets on hand, either through purchase or borrowing.

734,761,761,Excellent way to learn Electronics,"Electronics is my hobby and I have been searching for a book with a good selection of electronic experiments. This book is excellent. Although it gives a brief review of AC and DC electronics it really assumes the reader already has that basic knowledge. It then provides some nice tutorials on such things as JFET and bipolar transistor circuits. Every experiment is well designed and works perfectly. I'm about half way through the book and have been able to see how many circuits I have read about actually work. The components used are easily obtained and not too expensive. The only warning I would give is that to get full use of the material in the book you really do need a basic understanding of AC and DC circuits. You don't need to know anything very complicated, just the basics.",5,1118217322,"Electronics hobby I searching book good selection electronic experiments. This book excellent.

It lacks introduction material in basic DC and AC theory and series/parallel circuits, but does a good job identifying what knowledge is necessary in its Review and Pre-Test chapters, such that it would be simple to supplement with introductory material from another source.  It walks the student through a ton of breadboard circuit builds and experiments to solidify ideas presented in the chapters.  One negative is the how the presentation of information is interrupted by fill-in-the-blank style questions every other sentence, it seems.

736,763,763,This book needs a new edition ASAP!,"My background is someone that is currently self teaching himself electronics starting from zero. I started with electronics for inventors but realized that was a little too high level so I went with Make: Electronics instead, realized i still needed more theory so I bought Complete Electronics and Teach Yourself Electronics by Gibilsco. While this book has, in theory, all that you need, the experiments either need to be rewritten or they should admit that this is a companion textbook for someone with access to an electronics lab in college. It also does need a rewrite IMO, you don't need that many pages to explain transistor switching nor is it reasonable for a beginner to have 3 multimeters, a function generator and an oscilloscope for one experiment.

Compared to Gibilsco's book this was VERY unclear in a lot of areas for my taste and you absolutely need a bit of background to completely ""get it"". My advice, if you're teaching yourself, get Make: Electronics first and if you want/need more then run through this book with an electronics simulator and get Gibilsco's book while you're at it to get some better explanations for some concepts.

The ONLY reason I don't completely write this book off is because it does have a decent bit of math exercises for you to work with to to help memorize different equations you'll need down the road.",2,1118217322,"My background someone currently self teaching electronics starting zero.

754,781,781,Bluetooth sleeping mask that is perfect for me!,"For the past several years, I have purchased so many sleeping Bluetooth masks on Amazon and never been really happy with them. My head is smaller than I guess normal adult heads, so they were always too big and I would have to tighten it as far as they would go, while the Velcro on the strap would always stop sticking. I’m a side sleeper, so usually I would wake up and it feel like my ears were going to snap apart, they hurt so bad. Light would seep through. The loud warnings when they’re going dead waking me up while asleep.
I have bought musicozy in the past as well. I have actually found this brand to be my favorite out of all the brands I’ve tried. If I try another brand, I usually end up disappointed but still not satisfied completely with any of the musicozy sleeping mask, until I tried this one.
It’s so comfortable, no light seeps through between my nose, it fits my small head perfectly and for once, the Velcro stays in place.
The speakers don’t kill my ears when I wake up of the mornings. They no longer feel like they will snap off my face when I wake up. The speakers don’t move and stay in place. The volume is super comfortable. I can still hear my cats when they’re acting crazy at nights on top of the sleeping mask, but that’s totally fine. The charge on it lasts as long as all the others do that I’ve tried. I always have to charge them every other day. I threw away all of my previous sleeping masks that were still working away when I received this one. I’ve noticed they usually last for about a year or two, so when this one stops working, I’m afraid of trying another sleeping mask since I found this one. This one has been absolutely PERFECT for me and I will be buying again when I need a new one. I totally recommend this sleeping mask and musicozy. I have deeply regretted it anytime I’ve bought a different brand besides this one.
I also hardly ever write reviews on anything unless they are really really good or really really bad. And I’ve been meaning to write a review on this mask for awhile. I have been using them to sleep for the past 4 years consecutively and this is the best one I’ve tried in 4 years. While it might not be the best for other people, it is for me.
Def recommend if you have a small head and struggle trying to keep them on at nights without having to worry about the speakers moving around all over the place. When wake up, both my speakers are still resting comfortably on my ears. With some, I would wake up and the speakers would be at the back of my head or on top of my head. This is also great for side sleepers. I no longer wake up with very sore ears.

• Slow charging output when using both ports.
• C port is input only for charging the bank, not an output.

• Very small form factor for the capacity
• *Can be used as a power HUB, both charging and decharging simultaneously. Or, It may be pass-thru and charge, I have yet to verify if any charge rate declines when plugged input & output in tandem.

Immense [storage], incredibly cost effective if it functions anything close to how it appears.
Tiny (comparatively), smaller than 20k mAh and 30k mAh competitors.

815,849,849,It is approximately 4200mAH capacity instead of claimed 36800 giving just 11% of claimed efficiency!,"I got this intrigued by the battery capacity in a small form factor that could have been a great option to travel with. Solar charging is an additional feature too that could be very useful in situations when you are outdoors and there is no other AC power source to keep it charged. The very first thing I did is to fully charge and measure the capacitance (mAH) of these. I was really disappointed and would not recommend this product that is very reasonably priced but internally it is false marketing with higher numbers to disguise consumers.

My 2 cents are below:

Pros:
- Can charge multiple devices simultaneously
- Solar charging is a key feature but in my experience, it charges very slow & I ended up charging with a wall charger
- IP67 is waterproof and feels rugged overall
- Dual LED flashlights (680 lumens) are a nice addition to these
- Compass on the back of the power bank can be useful while outdoor recreations
- One of the slimmest & lightweight solar power banks in the market
- LED indicators in the device are very useful
- Very reasonably priced for the features it offers

Cons:
- On my tests ( I ran twice), this power bank only gave output capacitance of approximately 4200 mAH instead of claimed 36800 mAH. That's just 11% efficiency. I used a multimeter tester and a load with 2A power needs to test these (Results attached). These are really disappointing numbers & I believe battery capacity is false marketing being done for this product
- No fast USB-C PD (18W) charging in these
- No mention of safety standards like battery overcharge protection, overcurrent protection, output overvoltage protection, temperature control, short circuit protection, etc anywhere giving me less confidence in these
- Not a very great build quality. It feels plasticky & does not feel premium. Even the port cap fell off while using it
- Mismatch in use of manual directions. They say double click power button for flashlights but it works with a long press instead
- Came in generic packaging without any branding

818,852,852,"Had 2 of these, with mixed results~","I've had one of these for about 4 months now, using it to charge my phone when I forget and am on the go or at work and cant be anchored to a wall.  It works decently for my needs but note that one full charge cycle would only fully charge a near dead phone once (Standard Galaxy A21), with only enough left over for maybe 1/3 to 1/4 another phone charge, or 'almost' a full charge of my earbuds. Recharging the bank didn't take long (1.5-2.5 hours for 0-100%). The rate of recharge for devices drawing from the bank itself was about the same as when connected to a laptop battery via usb. Slower than a wall socket, but fast enough to gain power even while being used.    The bank's overall power storage capacity was nothing great by any means, but acceptable for the price point and the purpose of getting power and being able to keep the phone in your pocket in a pinch.  

I was satisfied enough with it to buy one more to leave at work permanently. This is the one that was a complete lemon. One of the two usb ports snapped off internally the second time I plugged something into it, which I ignored because I could still use the USB-c port or the second USB (all three ports work for drawing in or out power).  About 3 days and one full charge cycle later the battery began to fail completely.  I charged it fully, would plug it into my phone or earbuds for a charge, all appeared normal, but 5 minutes later the LED lights indicating a charge was in process would just turn off.  It would just shut itself off/stop working completely. Half an hour later if you reconnected the plugs it would again begin to charge with the lights claiming the battery was nearly full, but do the same thing again.   

Anyway its pretty much a paperweight now. It refuses to charge anything for more than 5-7 minutes without being left alone in a time out corner.

823,857,857,As advertised,"USB Type-C is just a super complicated situation all around.  The ports themselves can be USB 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, thunderbolt 3 or thunderbolt 4.  I'm probably missing something there.  That only covers data transfer speeds.  For power, a Type-C port can be rated for multiple voltages and amperages.  To protect the consumer from disaster (or they try anyway), each type-c product needs to be equipped with a chip that allows it to negotiate the speed and voltages.  This includes the cables.  The situation with cables is just as complicated.  A cable may only be able to charge at 5v and not carry any data.  They may carry only usb 2.0 data.  Better ones may be rated for high speed data but not high wattage.  Others have both high speeds and are rated for up to 100w.  Good luck trying to find the right cable once all of them are dumped in a drawer somewhere.

This 240W USB C to USB C Cable 6.6ft is yet another odd one in the bunch.  It is rated for high charging speeds but is only USB 2.0 for data.  Why is it necessary though?  I have a Dell Inspiron laptop that has a discreet NVidia RTX 3050 processor.  This means that it has a high power demand.

This Dell was also designed to charge only from a USB type-c port and the input power must be 130w.  So began my search for a charger that I can take with me when I'm away from my desk.  I was able to find a macbook style charger that outputs 140w but I didn't own any cables that were rated for higher than 100w.

I came across this cable and connected everything up.  During boot, the Dell's firmware still detected a low-powered charging device, but when I booted into Windows 11 and checked its power settings (after reconnecting the charger to the wall), Windows did not warn of an under powered charger as it normally would.  I was then able to use this charging setup to play a graphics intensive game for over an hour with no sign of GPU or CPU throttling.

The memory part of the game in fun but the basic x and o game is short and my children seem to lose interest quickly. The sound of the game when we play sounds a bit static.

Effectiveness: This cleaner does an excellent job of removing fingerprints, smudges, and dust without leaving any streaks behind. I'm particularly impressed with how it handles the delicate surfaces of my devices, ensuring that they look pristine after each use.

Size and Value: The 16oz bottle is quite generous, which means it lasts a long time even with regular use. It feels like good value for money, considering how often I need to clean various screens around my house.

Safe for All Screens: I appreciate that the formula is safe for all kinds of screens, including LCD, LED, and OLED.

Kit Contents: The kit comes with a large microfiber cloth, which is a perfect companion to the spray. The cloth is soft, does not shed fibers, and enhances the effectiveness of the spray by polishing the screens without scratching.

Spray Mechanism: The spray bottle works well and dispenses a fine mist that covers a good area with just a couple of sprays, which helps in using the liquid efficiently.

Minor Note: You receive two different spray nozzles.  One is the trigger type and one is a top pump type of nozzle.

879,917,917,Miracle Product! So worth it!,"This product FAR exceeded my expectations. So far I’ve used the spray on my glasses, my phones, my tablets and laptops, my Echo Show (smart home hub), my massive Smart TV and even the small screen of my Apple Watch. Everything came extremely clean, and most importantly there wasn’t a single steak to be found!

I've tried products like this before and they always leave streaks! This product left no trace! I like that it dries quickly, but on large devices (like a TV) it can dry a little too quickly so I advise spraying smaller areas at a time.
I prefer the small pump sprayer to conserve product, and really that’s all you need. Even on my 70” TV the small pump sprayer was plenty, I have not used the handle sprayer (the one that’s like a cleaning product sprayer).

I’m unsure if the product’s success is due to the chemical in the bottle or the towel it comes with, but either way it’s won me over. I have OCD and I’m a habitual screen cleaner. I can’t stand to use a device with fingerprints or watch a TV with dust and streaks. I’ve tried everything, from windex to vinegar, and even online cleaning hacks, none of them leave a truly streak free clean. This product achieves a streak free clean with little to no effort, I dare say even a child could use this with good results.

I plan to come back to this review in a few months to update on how the towel is holding up, I’ve only had this a week or two now. I would highly suggest if anyone washes the towel they DO NOT use any detergent or softeners because it will undoubtedly leave residues and muck up the towel, which would transfer to your devices.

The only negative I will include with my review is that the towel does give me a bit of an ick type feeling, but that’s ONLY due to sensory issues of my own, and NOT a product defect. I typically experience this with most microfiber towels. It felt like my skin was grabbing the fibers and I could hear it scraping like nails on a chalk board. Again - I can’t stress enough this is due to my own personal sensory issues. Any neurotypical person would likely not have the same experience. But for my neuro-spicy peeps out there I’d recommend wearing gloves to solve the sensory issue.

TLDR - Buy the spray. It will change how you clean your devices forever. All of them. It’s streak free, easy to use, and a little bit of product goes a long way. 10/10 recommend, I will be back for more AND plan to start gifting this to all my tech loving friends.",5,B0997HW4JP,"This product FAR exceeded expectations.

ATTENTION: THIS EATS RUBBER COATING!!

After wiping my monitor and cleaning it fully I wiped my NEW mouse off and discovered it clearly left the rubber in shambles!!! My mouse was a rubber coated gaming mouse… but now it’s uncoated due to this product!!! Thankfully… removing all the rubber actually made it OKAY. NOT AS INTENDED.. but I have to make do.

A lot of computer products use rubber - I can’t imagine if this damaged something more valuable. I was able to “save” my mouse best I could in this situation.

Pros:
Works to clean Asus monitor.
No streaks, no heavy wiping, no smell.

890,928,928,Nice wallet alternative,"I like old fashioned trifold leather wallets that can hold unlimited amount of cards and photos in them but they get bulky. This is the tradeoff. I am so used to trifolds to slide bills in and this has a pseudo bi-fold from the viewpoint of putting bills in as it leaves the other third hanging out of the wallet but does fold in over itself.

I've looked at ridge wallets before but those just have a money clip to hold money, not smart to advertise you have cash and I'm not sure how secure cash in a clip is, but in full transparency, I haven't owned one either.

A couple annoyances for me on this wallet is that it has a pocket for an airtag that makes it wider. Cool it has this for those that want it but I solved this with a seam ripper, removing the pocket. It leaves some holes where it was sewn together though, but I use this for a reminder for my other annoyance...

So, the wallet has NFC blocking built into it, which is great to protecting against card scanning, but I like to have my employee badge in my wallet so when I need to open a secure door, I put my wallet on the sensor and I'm good. This wallet mostly blocks this. To get around this, I placed my badge in the middle fold, at the very back and press the wallet that used to have the airtag pocket against the door sensor plate. If I push the wallet against the sensor, it still catches, at least for most of the doors.

I chose this wallet as it had more space for cards than some of the other ridge-like wallets, and has a fold to place bills in, instead of a clip. It is smaller than my old trifold leather wallet and so I still had to reduce down what went in it... goodbye saver cards!

In the back pocket, it feels comfortable, even with hard plastic, because of the smaller size, fits better, whereas the leather would stick way out but bend however it needed to.",3,B0CLGXF95S,"I like old fashioned trifold leather wallets hold unlimited amount cards photos get bulky.

The suction part is very well thought out, on top of using vacuum suction to attach itself, it also uses a sticky material that alone in my initial test held the mount to a table with my heavy phone attached to its end and it stick so we'll that I had I hard time actually dismounting it no vacuum used!
One issue I have is not with this mount specifically but rather all mounts of similar design (extended arm) as they typically tend to have the phone bounce more, it's a physics problem as the load (phone) is farther from the anchoring point (suction cup). My other issue is the inability of swinging the arm left and right once positioned. You kinda have ""one shot"" at positioning it right, you could still tilt the magsafe part sideways to compensate for missplacement, but if you want the arm to adjust the arm, you'd need to unmount and remount again. Other than that, this is a great magsafe mount.

906,945,945,Effective and Convenient,"I purchased the 16oz Screen Cleaner Spray recently and have been using it to maintain all my screens—from my large OLED TV to my smartphones and iPad. Here's what I've found:

Effectiveness: This cleaner does an excellent job of removing fingerprints, smudges, and dust without leaving any streaks behind. I'm particularly impressed with how it handles the delicate surfaces of my devices, ensuring that they look pristine after each use.

Size and Value: The 16oz bottle is quite generous, which means it lasts a long time even with regular use. It feels like good value for money, considering how often I need to clean various screens around my house.

Safe for All Screens: I appreciate that the formula is safe for all kinds of screens, including LCD, LED, and OLED.

Kit Contents: The kit comes with a large microfiber cloth, which is a perfect companion to the spray. The cloth is soft, does not shed fibers, and enhances the effectiveness of the spray by polishing the screens without scratching.

Spray Mechanism: The spray bottle works well and dispenses a fine mist that covers a good area with just a couple of sprays, which helps in using the liquid efficiently.

Minor Note: You receive two different spray nozzles.  One is the trigger type and one is a top pump type of nozzle.

910,949,949,Miracle Product! So worth it!,"This product FAR exceeded my expectations. So far I’ve used the spray on my glasses, my phones, my tablets and laptops, my Echo Show (smart home hub), my massive Smart TV and even the small screen of my Apple Watch. Everything came extremely clean, and most importantly there wasn’t a single steak to be found!

I've tried products like this before and they always leave streaks! This product left no trace! I like that it dries quickly, but on large devices (like a TV) it can dry a little too quickly so I advise spraying smaller areas at a time.
I prefer the small pump sprayer to conserve product, and really that’s all you need. Even on my 70” TV the small pump sprayer was plenty, I have not used the handle sprayer (the one that’s like a cleaning product sprayer).

I’m unsure if the product’s success is due to the chemical in the bottle or the towel it comes with, but either way it’s won me over. I have OCD and I’m a habitual screen cleaner. I can’t stand to use a device with fingerprints or watch a TV with dust and streaks. I’ve tried everything, from windex to vinegar, and even online cleaning hacks, none of them leave a truly streak free clean. This product achieves a streak free clean with little to no effort, I dare say even a child could use this with good results.

I plan to come back to this review in a few months to update on how the towel is holding up, I’ve only had this a week or two now. I would highly suggest if anyone washes the towel they DO NOT use any detergent or softeners because it will undoubtedly leave residues and muck up the towel, which would transfer to your devices.

The only negative I will include with my review is that the towel does give me a bit of an ick type feeling, but that’s ONLY due to sensory issues of my own, and NOT a product defect. I typically experience this with most microfiber towels. It felt like my skin was grabbing the fibers and I could hear it scraping like nails on a chalk board. Again - I can’t stress enough this is due to my own personal sensory issues. Any neurotypical person would likely not have the same experience. But for my neuro-spicy peeps out there I’d recommend wearing gloves to solve the sensory issue.

TLDR - Buy the spray. It will change how you clean your devices forever. All of them. It’s streak free, easy to use, and a little bit of product goes a long way. 10/10 recommend, I will be back for more AND plan to start gifting this to all my tech loving friends.",5,B0997HW4JP,"This product FAR exceeded expectations.

If it would have damaged it as it did my mouse, my review of this product would have been very hostile! However upon the discovery of it eating the rubber off my mouse, I fully removed the rubber.. and my mouse was thankfully “SAVED”.

ATTENTION: THIS EATS RUBBER COATING!!

After wiping my monitor and cleaning it fully I wiped my NEW mouse off and discovered it clearly left the rubber in shambles!!! My mouse was a rubber coated gaming mouse… but now it’s uncoated due to this product!!! Thankfully… removing all the rubber actually made it OKAY. NOT AS INTENDED.. but I have to make do. I CAN’T BELIEVE THIS HAPPENED!

This product fully removed residue on my monitor. But left my mouse “naked”. The mouse became sticky, gummy, streaky, and abhorrent. I was about to give up cleaning my mouse and throw it away because it was SO BAD! I continued cleaning off the rubber and it’s fine… but BEWARE! A lot of computer products use rubber - I can’t imagine if this damaged something more valuable. I was able to “save” my mouse best I could in this situation.

Pros:
Works to clean Asus monitor.
No streaks, no heavy wiping, no smell.
Large bottle for cost.
Decent sized cloth for wiping. - Very soft, but grippy enough for grime.
Free stickers!

930,970,970,Nice wallet alternative,"I like old fashioned trifold leather wallets that can hold unlimited amount of cards and photos in them but they get bulky. This is the tradeoff. I am so used to trifolds to slide bills in and this has a pseudo bi-fold from the viewpoint of putting bills in as it leaves the other third hanging out of the wallet but does fold in over itself.

I've looked at ridge wallets before but those just have a money clip to hold money, not smart to advertise you have cash and I'm not sure how secure cash in a clip is, but in full transparency, I haven't owned one either.

A couple annoyances for me on this wallet is that it has a pocket for an airtag that makes it wider. Cool it has this for those that want it but I solved this with a seam ripper, removing the pocket. It leaves some holes where it was sewn together though, but I use this for a reminder for my other annoyance...

So, the wallet has NFC blocking built into it, which is great to protecting against card scanning, but I like to have my employee badge in my wallet so when I need to open a secure door, I put my wallet on the sensor and I'm good. This wallet mostly blocks this. To get around this, I placed my badge in the middle fold, at the very back and press the wallet that used to have the airtag pocket against the door sensor plate. If I push the wallet against the sensor, it still catches, at least for most of the doors.

I chose this wallet as it had more space for cards than some of the other ridge-like wallets, and has a fold to place bills in, instead of a clip. It is smaller than my old trifold leather wallet and so I still had to reduce down what went in it... goodbye saver cards!

In the back pocket, it feels comfortable, even with hard plastic, because of the smaller size, fits better, whereas the leather would stick way out but bend however it needed to.",3,B0CLGXF95S,"I like old fashioned trifold leather wallets hold unlimited amount cards photos get bulky.

947,988,988,Next Best Thing To Rat Zapper - But For Mice!,"Most Victor products have been pretty reliable in my experience. I live in a rural ranch area where mice sometimes wander in and so does the occasional rat. I used to have a $60 rat zapper that was amazing for both rats and mice, but I loaned it out and never got it back, and haven't replaced it yet.

This seems very similar but much smaller than my old zapper. It's very easy to use. It's still too soon to have caught any mice in it yet, but when their season ramps up it should be a great tool.

I think these zappers are the most humane tools for mouse control as they are zapped once instantly and don't suffer. All the other traps have had exceptions, and I refuse to use a method where a creature will suffer -- especially not poison. Peanut butter is the best attractant I've ever used, and a tiny bit goes a long way with their sensitive noses.

This trap's openings are so small that my current cats won't be harmed by them. That was one of my concerns about the larger rat zapper, and I kept that one in a room that was always closed off to kids and pets.

If any issues or problems come up through the season as I use this, I will come back to update. I'm confident that this will deliver the humane results I'm looking for, but as yet unused, I will rate it 4 stars for now, subject to change if necessary.",4,B0CQ8QTXS9,"Most Victor products pretty reliable experience.

961,1007,1007,Critical Resource For Embedded System Hardware And Software Developers,"""Applied Embedded Electronics"" by Jerry Twomey is an excellent practical introduction to a wide range of hardware topics for embedded systems. It’s a critical resource for anyone working on embedded systems hardware or software. I highly recommend it!

It covers dozens of things I’ve run into on schematics and PCB’s and in code over the years working on a variety of systems. Some of those were idle curiosity, “That’s interesting,” and some were critical things that I had to go learn about in order to get my work done.

This book is enormously helpful. Even for things I was already familiar with, it provides an additional level of detail.

One of the main themes is the non-ideal nature of real hardware, as opposed to the academic ideal treatment in other books. It outlines the various things you need to account for to make things actually work and prevent problems. That starts right away in chapter 1, “Essential Concepts,” where it outlines the actual inductance and capacitance present at various points, and carries through all subsequent chapters.

I really like chapter 2, “Architecting the System.” This uses a symbol notation that’s higher level than raw schematics to model functional blocks, making it easy to understand and talk about them. That’s another thing carried through subsequent chapters.

Following individual chapters on major subsystems, blocks, and peripherals, chapter 10, “Digital Feedback Control,” provides an excellent summary bringing classical analog control theory into the modern digital realm. It covers PID control and variations using an all-digital pipeline of input sensor, ADC, DCU (Digital Control Unit, which could be MCU software or programmable logic, such as an FPGA, and may include DSP blocks), DAC, and output device.

Chapter 11, “Schematic to PCB,” covers a wide range of practical considerations for designing real-world PCB’s.

This is definitely a hardware book, not a software book. Chapter 12, “Software and Coding,” briefly covers a number of important practical real-world considerations. Readers interested in detailed software coverage can use Elecia White's new edition of “Making Embedded Systems” for bare-metal systems, and Brian Amos' “Hands-On RTOS with Microcontrollers” for RTOS-based systems.

Chapter 13, “Special Systems and Applications,” covers the varying requirements and considerations for different industries and markets, including regulatory issues.

Chapter 14, “Creating Great Products,” briefly outlines the process for product creation.

Each chapter ends with a “Further Reading” list for deeper exploration. These are a great resource for following up the introduction the book provides.",5,1098144791,"""Applied Embedded Electronics"" Jerry Twomey excellent practical introduction wide range hardware topics embedded systems.

962,1008,1008,A very practical approach for real world embedded hardware design!,"I’ve been searching for a book like this for a long time!

I’m a Mechatronics Engineer and have been working for almost 15 years with embedded systems design for medical equipment, especially hardware design. This book brings so much stuff that I deal with daily, and it is good to see I’m on the right track. Nonetheless, I learned a lot of new concepts and had many insights while reading it.

The text is very well written and easy to understand. The author does not go deep into formulas and mathematics, it is a more practical and industry oriented approach, which I like. That’s not to say the book simplifies things – on the contrary, since the first chapter, the author debunks simplifications we had in academia and showcases real world problems hardware designers must face and solve, beginning with the simplest components such as resistors and capacitors, and building up to PCB design, EMC and signal integrity. There are also some interesting topics such as control, software, certification, and product design, that are very important in embedded systems, although not strictly related to electronics. I loved how broad the book is, covering many essential disciplines.

At the end of each chapter, there are plenty of references if you want to examine the topics further.

I recommend this book to anyone interested in working professionally with embedded hardware design. I wish I had that available when I was starting, as it would have saved me from a lot of trouble!

971,1018,1018,"Great Wipes, Horrible Dispenser","Bottom Line on Top: Wipes are really great, but the container is literally worse than useless.

First, set your expectations for the wipe: If you are looking for a wipe that will clean a 60"" TV in one swipe (as some of the reviewers seem to expect), that isn't going to exist. One wipe will thoroughly clean a good-sized monitor or a couple tablets. Like any cleaner, the first pass removed dust and starts to soften smudges and spot, then a series of circular scrubs removes the rest. If wipes were all I graded, this might well have gotten five stars.

However, to get a wipe to do anything, you have to get it out of the container. DO NOT BE FOOLED by the pictures of quick-dispensed cleaning cloths like you'd expect from Baby Wipes or Tub O'Towels. This lid is hard, thick plastic that very effectively ensures you get one wipe at a time -- as in you have to reopen the container and thread a new one every single time you need a wipe. None of this ""follow the leader"" dispensing that you gets from every other product from Kleenex to Clorox. Further, the way the wipes themselves are wound in their plastic prison makes is screamingly frustrating to get the next one started, and the one after that simply will never follow it out.

I never thought that packaging could cost a product two stars, but it probably would have been three if the wipes weren't just so darn *good*. There is no offensive odour, no residue, no smudged or streaks, ""no muss, no fuss, no worries.""

985,1032,1032,A Must For Learning Electronics,"WOW!  This book seems to be packed with all the info you'll need to fix electronics on your own.  And its content is printed in a tone that makes it easy for newbies or wanna-bes to understand.  It clearly expresses everything from all the downfalls of fixing things yourself and most common mistakes that you'll want to avoid.  Attempting to fix electronics can be scary, especially if you don't know what most of the small components within the unit are or what they do.  However, this book sums everything up clearly for you.

After reading it completely, there's no guarantee that you'll become a repairman, and even if you never do, you will take away a lot of info that you can benefit from when dealing with broken down electronics in the future.

The only thing is the print is rather small as compared to most books and the ink is a bit light, making it harder to read.  There are a lot of illustrations and pictures in it, but the bulk of them are in black and white.

Overall, if you have great vision and want to learn more about electronics, this book is definitely a must.",5,0071848290,"WOW! This book seems packed info need fix electronics own.

987,1034,1034,A Great Book but Misleading Title,"Overall, I learned a lot from this book and I can still learn something new every time I pick it up.  Geier has a great writing style and a deep knowledge of his subject.  He's an Electron Whisperer.  This is not a book for beginners.  It requires at least a working knowledge of components and soldering; he covers them but not in any detail.  There is also very little formal explanation of theory so don't buy it for that.  But the book is laced with practical advice from a guy who has been in the trenches and that part is invaluable.  His oscilloscope training and suggestions are very good as far as operating the device.  But if you want hands-on description of how it's used for diagnosing and troubleshooting, look elsewehere.  He devotes one long chapter to advice on workshop and tools: immediate essentials vs. what to put off and in what order to buy them.

And there are stories.  He also tells many stories of tough jobs and how he diagnosed and fixed them.  These stories are entertaining and informative, and each one is there to illustrate his methodology of troubleshooting.  However, including so many of them took up space that could have been put to better use.  We don't all think alike and what the reader expects (based on the title) is practical advice that will help him/her develop their own knowledge base and troubleshooting style within their own field of interest.  I would have been happier if the book had more directions, more rules of thumb, more flowcharts and tables.  there is much good information here, just fragmented and scattered throughout the book by his folksy and (admittedly) entertaining style.  But the style is too conversational.  We could have used more of ""Do this, then do that, etc.""  without having to hear so much of what went through his head as he was learning it.

But I can't give it five stars because of that title.  Sadly, it will NOT teach you ""How To Diagnose And Fix Everything Electronic.""  It  covers too much territory, and too many types of electronic devices. Most devices are not covered in any depth, just a few quick hints and any necessary warnings about the critter in hand.  What's missing is a systematic overview of how the technician approaches a non-working device.  Like Golfer's review I would have like to see a lot more tables with step by step instructions, or flowcharts showing what to test and then branches to take depending on the outcome of each previous round of tests.  My main interest is in guitar amps, and how to troubleshoot amplifiers is given only superficial coverage, and scattered around the book.  Whatever your main interest is, you'll probably feel the same way: a few interesting stories, a few bits of good advice, and then sent on your way without much in the way of solid skills in diagnosis or troubleshooting.

I hate to be negative because in its own way, it's readable and informative and encouraging to someone trying to learn more.  But in a way, it's more of an autobiography of his career fixing a large variety of products.  ""My Life Fixing Electrical Things"" might have been a better title.",4,0071848290,"Overall, I learned lot book I still learn something new every time I pick up.

I don't see 8-track players or tube televisions much anymore outside of museums, but who knows, maybe I'll want to restore one someday.

989,1036,1036,Valuable knowledge written in an easy-to-read style.,"I almost didn't buy this book after having read some of the reviews. They complained that it didn't really give much useful information, that is was ""wordy"" and it didn't really tell you how to repair ""everything"".  I'm on my second read-through, so I've found it far from useless. It IS written in a narrative style with anecdotal tales and a touch of humor, so if what you're looking for is dry, scientific fact, then this book is probably not for you. However, I personally comprehend more when material is presented in a narrative style.
The author presents numerous topics including a philosophy of why to repair broken electronics; the test equipment necessary to make the repairs and a basic guide to using each piece; the common components that make up electrical circuits and how to identify and test them; a logical approach to reading schematics (very valuable!); how to identify common failures in electronic equipment and then methodically find the component(s) to replace; and the methods for opening seemingly impenetrable cases on laptops, tablets, phones, etc. and getting them back together without destroying them. Finally, he takes the reader through a number of real-life repair scenarios to explain how he identified the problem and brought the unit back to life.
So bottom line: does this book tell you how to repair 'Everything Electronic'? No and yes! Obviously, the author cannot cover every single electronic item with a blow-by-blow description of the diagnostic and repair. What he does give are the basics to understanding common circuit function, how to identify the culprit of failure in a circuit and a logical method for repairing the circuit to correctly functioning status.

You learn what to get, how to shop wisely, and how to use them (of course). This takes up quite a few chapters. Then you get down to business. You learn about electronic components and what things are likely to go wrong in the devices you are most likely to come across. With this knowledge, electronic devices become comprehensible equipment instead of mystery boxes. That's what I like. I like to learn about things. I like to take the mystery out of things.

Now for the bad, which has nothing to do with the book. The bad thing is that acquiring all the necessary, and a good chunk of the &#34;cool&#34; tools, will run into the thousands. You also have to have a dedicated work area, so if you are short on space already... Finally, it takes time to troubleshoot and repair things. If you are retired, no problem. But if you have to make a living, it will be much cheaper and easier to have someone do the repair for you or just buy a whole new item (depending on the problem).

If you get satisfaction from learning and tinkering, get this book. If you are curious about this sort of thing, but can't afford the tools, space, or time, you might get the book anyway to learn what you can.

1025,1077,1077,"Great Wipes, Horrible Dispenser","Bottom Line on Top: Wipes are really great, but the container is literally worse than useless.

First, set your expectations for the wipe: If you are looking for a wipe that will clean a 60"" TV in one swipe (as some of the reviewers seem to expect), that isn't going to exist. One wipe will thoroughly clean a good-sized monitor or a couple tablets. Like any cleaner, the first pass removed dust and starts to soften smudges and spot, then a series of circular scrubs removes the rest. If wipes were all I graded, this might well have gotten five stars.

However, to get a wipe to do anything, you have to get it out of the container. DO NOT BE FOOLED by the pictures of quick-dispensed cleaning cloths like you'd expect from Baby Wipes or Tub O'Towels. This lid is hard, thick plastic that very effectively ensures you get one wipe at a time -- as in you have to reopen the container and thread a new one every single time you need a wipe. None of this ""follow the leader"" dispensing that you gets from every other product from Kleenex to Clorox. Further, the way the wipes themselves are wound in their plastic prison makes is screamingly frustrating to get the next one started, and the one after that simply will never follow it out.

I never thought that packaging could cost a product two stars, but it probably would have been three if the wipes weren't just so darn *good*. There is no offensive odour, no residue, no smudged or streaks, ""no muss, no fuss, no worries.""

+ Effectively removes fingerprints, dust, and smudges
+ Leaves screens streak-free and crystal clear
+ Easy to use spray bottle design
+ Versatile - works on various screen types (TVs, monitors, smartphones)
+ Large 16oz bottle provides ample supply
+ Comes with a microfiber cloth

Cons:
- May require multiple passes and buffing with a dry cloth to completely eliminate streaks
- Slightly more expensive compared to some other screen cleaning products
- The included microfiber cloth could be of better quality

I decided to give the EVEO Screen Cleaner Spray a try after reading numerous positive reviews from satisfied customers. Many mentioned how effectively it removes fingerprints, dust, and smudges, leaving their screens crystal clear and streak-free. The easy-to-use spray bottle design and the included microfiber cloth also seemed to be appreciated by many.

Additionally, while the included microfiber cloth gets the job done, I feel it could be of slightly better quality.

1070,1123,1123,A Great Book but Misleading Title,"Overall, I learned a lot from this book and I can still learn something new every time I pick it up.  Geier has a great writing style and a deep knowledge of his subject.  He's an Electron Whisperer.  This is not a book for beginners.  It requires at least a working knowledge of components and soldering; he covers them but not in any detail.  There is also very little formal explanation of theory so don't buy it for that.  But the book is laced with practical advice from a guy who has been in the trenches and that part is invaluable.  His oscilloscope training and suggestions are very good as far as operating the device.  But if you want hands-on description of how it's used for diagnosing and troubleshooting, look elsewehere.  He devotes one long chapter to advice on workshop and tools: immediate essentials vs. what to put off and in what order to buy them.

And there are stories.  He also tells many stories of tough jobs and how he diagnosed and fixed them.  These stories are entertaining and informative, and each one is there to illustrate his methodology of troubleshooting.  However, including so many of them took up space that could have been put to better use.  We don't all think alike and what the reader expects (based on the title) is practical advice that will help him/her develop their own knowledge base and troubleshooting style within their own field of interest.  I would have been happier if the book had more directions, more rules of thumb, more flowcharts and tables.  there is much good information here, just fragmented and scattered throughout the book by his folksy and (admittedly) entertaining style.  But the style is too conversational.  We could have used more of ""Do this, then do that, etc.""  without having to hear so much of what went through his head as he was learning it.

But I can't give it five stars because of that title.  Sadly, it will NOT teach you ""How To Diagnose And Fix Everything Electronic.""  It  covers too much territory, and too many types of electronic devices. Most devices are not covered in any depth, just a few quick hints and any necessary warnings about the critter in hand.  What's missing is a systematic overview of how the technician approaches a non-working device.  Like Golfer's review I would have like to see a lot more tables with step by step instructions, or flowcharts showing what to test and then branches to take depending on the outcome of each previous round of tests.  My main interest is in guitar amps, and how to troubleshoot amplifiers is given only superficial coverage, and scattered around the book.  Whatever your main interest is, you'll probably feel the same way: a few interesting stories, a few bits of good advice, and then sent on your way without much in the way of solid skills in diagnosis or troubleshooting.

I hate to be negative because in its own way, it's readable and informative and encouraging to someone trying to learn more.  But in a way, it's more of an autobiography of his career fixing a large variety of products.

1072,1125,1125,Valuable knowledge written in an easy-to-read style.,"I almost didn't buy this book after having read some of the reviews. They complained that it didn't really give much useful information, that is was ""wordy"" and it didn't really tell you how to repair ""everything"".  I'm on my second read-through, so I've found it far from useless. It IS written in a narrative style with anecdotal tales and a touch of humor, so if what you're looking for is dry, scientific fact, then this book is probably not for you. However, I personally comprehend more when material is presented in a narrative style.
The author presents numerous topics including a philosophy of why to repair broken electronics; the test equipment necessary to make the repairs and a basic guide to using each piece; the common components that make up electrical circuits and how to identify and test them; a logical approach to reading schematics (very valuable!); how to identify common failures in electronic equipment and then methodically find the component(s) to replace; and the methods for opening seemingly impenetrable cases on laptops, tablets, phones, etc. and getting them back together without destroying them. Finally, he takes the reader through a number of real-life repair scenarios to explain how he identified the problem and brought the unit back to life.
So bottom line: does this book tell you how to repair 'Everything Electronic'? No and yes! Obviously, the author cannot cover every single electronic item with a blow-by-blow description of the diagnostic and repair. What he does give are the basics to understanding common circuit function, how to identify the culprit of failure in a circuit and a logical method for repairing the circuit to correctly functioning status.

You learn what to get, how to shop wisely, and how to use them (of course). This takes up quite a few chapters. Then you get down to business. You learn about electronic components and what things are likely to go wrong in the devices you are most likely to come across. With this knowledge, electronic devices become comprehensible equipment instead of mystery boxes. That's what I like. I like to learn about things. I like to take the mystery out of things.

Now for the bad, which has nothing to do with the book. The bad thing is that acquiring all the necessary, and a good chunk of the &#34;cool&#34; tools, will run into the thousands. You also have to have a dedicated work area, so if you are short on space already... Finally, it takes time to troubleshoot and repair things. If you are retired, no problem.

1079,1132,1132,A comic book for (would be) electronics nerds,"This was not, in fact, the book that taught me electronics. That honor goes to Charles Platt's Make: Electronics.  However, if I had discovered it in the 80s or 90s before Platt's book existed, I'm sure it would have done the job. It's less hands-on than Platt's book, and doesn't offer as much hand-holding or practical advice for beginners, but it's very accessible nonetheless.  The explanations are clear, if concise, and the drawings are very elucidating.  The book explains everything you need to know about the fundamentals of electricity as well as the passive components and transistors that you'll need to build basic circuits.  It also covers a few of the classic linear and digital ICs, but it was written before microcontrollers became commonplace, so it doesn't even mention them.

But none of this explains my attachment to this book, which is on a much more emotional level. The fact that the entire book is handwritten and hand-illustrated gives it a very personal touch. The drawings are whimsical and endearing. How can you not smile at the illustrations of electrons gleefully zipping down a wire, or at a MOSFET with lightning bolts shooting out of its head because it got zapped by static?  Even if you already know everything that you could possibly learn from this book, it's still worth a read.  As the title of this review suggests, it's like a comic book for electronic nerds.

1080,1133,1133,Off to a Good Start,"This is an excellent book to learn the fundamentals to get started learning electronics. I really don't have much of a background in electronics. I got this book because I read about it in Make Magazine. Also I have been trying to complete a correspondence course in electronics. This book reviewed what I had already learned in a fraction of the number of pages that I had to read. It also introduce things that my course hasn't cover yet. Not bad for 128 pages.

Think about it: many high schools don't have an electronics program. Mine didn't. It isn't that the material is unimportant or doesn't have job opportunities. The electronic field is huge. This is the book to start with if you know nothing of electronics and are doing a self study.

The book is easy to understand. It wasn't until it discusses ""Digital Integrated Circuits"" in chapter 6 that I did not have a full understanding of the material. But I guess this is just a ""start"" to learning such topics. But I think it works, because it is more advanced and thus gets the reader's interest. However diode and transistor gates can become complicated.

It is important to note there is not much math here except for some basic algebra. A few formulas, truth tables, and graphs of functions are present but the book uses them to show how electronics are represented and not to have the reader do many math problems.

I have yet to build the circuit projects in the back of the book. That is the next step. Forrest Mims, the author, states that you have to do them to get the complete understanding of circuits. That makes sense.

1081,1134,1134,A Wonderful Book to Have When Starting with Arduino,"The whole Arduino phenomenon has done wonders for reigniting an interest in the type of gadgetry you can purchase in the ever-shrinking storage drawers in the back of the Shack, and as you start to implement some of the ""cookbook"" style designs that are online, those new to the electronics / integrated cirucit world will start to have a plethora of questions, such as (1) what's an RC circuit, or (2) how does a pullup resistor work in my Arduino product, and what is its purpose?

Forrest Mimms does an excellent job providing an overall introduction to electronic components that suitable for the advanced elementary school / middle school student to the neophyte-non-engineer adult. His no-nonsense drawings combine the aesthetic of comic-strip photos with the handwritten-all-caps look of engineering textual notation. This book makes understanding elementary electronics a fun journey, and if you're actually making the projects and examples he delineates in the text, you'll develop an almost intuitve grasp of the subject. I'm not saying that you'll become an expert in the subject - but as you get into more abstract / mathematical areas of electronics and circuit building, you'll feel as if you know how to swim.

I purchased this book because I cannot stand fiddling with things when I don't know how they work. I can't stand just following cookbook examples from Adafruit or other Arduino cookbooks available online, dropping in C++ libraries and code and plugging wires into a little blue board to watch LED's flash - I have to know what's causing what. I have been impressed with the utility of this book because it explains the concepts behind the schematics and the code you play with on an Arduino board. Forrest Mimms has an extensive amount of knowledge of the subject matter, and unlike many other ""engineering"" texts, he presents his information in a way that spoon-feeds the neophyte and re-emphasizes the basics for someone with a cursory understanding of electronics and circuits.

Whether you are introducing a child to your field - and getting them started in electronics - or you're delving in for the first time yourself, before you go pick up that book on advanced engineering mathematics or a schematics reading guide, grab this book. Its images will serve as a strong mental reference for a long time to come and will answer a number (but not all) of the ""why's"" and ""how's"" behind the maker projects you work your way through but don't completely understand.

And do consider many of the other books out there by Mimms - I believe he has written a whole book on the 555 IC. His texts are invaluable whether a beginner in microelectronics and circuits, a student, or even an experienced hand who enjoys an entertaining refresher. His ""voice"" in his texts is that of an amazing layman teacher - that voice and command of the subject matter possessed by the true teachers that take byzantine concepts and systems and make them accessible to the everyman. I speak from experience, and have thoroughly enjoyed FM's books - which I am now sharing with my two elementary school-aged sons.",4,0945053282,"The whole Arduino phenomenon done wonders reigniting interest type gadgetry purchase ever-shrinking storage drawers back Shack, start implement ""cookbook"" style designs online, new electronics / integrated cirucit world start plethora questions, (1) what's RC circuit, (2) pullup resistor work Arduino product, purpose?

1082,1135,1135,Perfect for intelligent people with little prior knowledge of electronics,"This book is great. Amazingly as the Amazon prompt came it to review it I had the book sitting right there next to my computer. I've read it from cover to cover and reread the bits I'm really interested in.

What I like most about this book is that it is written by someone who clearly knows everything there is to know about electronics and then, not only distilled it down to just the necessary facts to 'get started in electronics', but he's presented the material as if I'd written my own notes in a lecture - actually the diagrams he draws are much better than anything I could draw. So everything in the book seems to be spot on my level of understanding, and really, if you have any real interest in electronics I can't see how you could not understand the information as it is presented.

Highly recommend this book to anyone who has no prior knowledge or only the most basic understanding of electronics but has the desire to learn more and simply needs the explanations to be intelligent, not for an idiot, the jargon removed and the analogies easy to relate to. Forrest hits the nail right on the head.

1086,1139,1139,Blown away (figuratively speaking)!,"I have this book 4 stars for a multitude of reasons.

I'm a high school junior (10th grade) who has taken an extreme liking to electronics and programming. I'm the main electronics person in Robotics, a developer/music technician in Game Development club, and the audio tech in Broadcasting Club.

I knew almost nothing about anything related to electricity or robots before this year, yes I knew I wanted to be an electrical engineer and computer scientist.

So recently I saved up enough money to buy:

- an Arduino starter kit (not the rip-off $90 one from Arduino itself, this one: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HI0RYJK/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3)

-a big book of electrical components- tells what they are, what they do and how they do it: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449333893/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2

and of course, this book.

What I really love about this book, and I know it's strange, is the fact that it's handwritten. You know how boring it is to look at the same font, in the same text size everyday for a student? The fact that the author wrote it and just used his handwriting is so refreshing. It also adds that I write in all caps myself, so I can relate even more.

Also, this could just be me being ditsy but I didn't know he would be talking about the actually matter part of electricity! He talks about what electricity is, lots of examples of how it's used and multiple drawing on every page.

But I do have a couple draw backs. Sometimes I can become very confused on some of the descriptions. But I think that's just me, and in my opinion he did very well describing things that cannot sense with any of your 5 senses. Also, some of the pictures confuse me, but after rereading and looking over the pictures for a minute I understand them better :)

The last things I want to say are:

-He includes space in the back of the book for you to write notes
-He has 100 freaking electronics schematics just WAITING for you to work on! They're the last chapter after he's done educating you on the topic in his book.

Okay, wait...the last thing I actually have to say is: DON'T FREAKING SKIP THE FIRST CHAPTER! If you do, you won't have a full understanding of what electricity really is, what it means and what it does! (The first chapter is basically about currents, volts adn electrons).

I 100% recommend this book, and I'm currently applying the information I learned in this book to an internship I got at a biochemical research laboratory this summer :)",4,0945053282,"I book 4 stars multitude reasons.

1126,1187,1187,PRO tips for the PS4 PRO,"These fans are great for ensuring circulation, cooling, and minimizing fan noise for your PS4.
I’ll list some PRO TIPS below (pun intended).

READ BELOW FOR THE TIPS.

Though it’s completely normal for your PS4 to get medium-hot, it never hurts to maximize cooling for any electronic... ESPECIALLY in enclosed places.

When the system is cooler, the internal fan don’t need to work as hard, maximizing efficiency and naturally prolonging the life expectancy and overall reducing its noise.

These fans are super quiet and by keeping the system cool, the internal fans don’t need to work half as hard, thus reducing overall noise significantly... Which is a great bonus.

With these fans on high setting, placed like in my photos, my PS4 never exceeds a mild warmth.

These fans are versatile, allowing you to link more fans if you’d like, and allowing you to set them up however you’d like depending on your setting.

NOW FOR THE TIPS:

1. Do this first!
You’re probably aiming to reduce noise and/or keep the system as cool as possible, so I’d HIGHLY recommend to begin by dusting out the internal fan just for the added benefit. It’s very simple with the PS4 PRO. Simply pop off the top cover and air dust or lightly wipe off the fans and place the cover back in. (Refer to how-to videos online). This’ll keep the internal fans running efficiently.

2. USB tips:
(1). There is a hidden USB port in the BACK of the PS4 PRO use that one to keep it out of the way and to leave your front two USB ports free.
(It can turn on and off with your PS4)
(2). You’re likely using a 4K TV or any TV with many ports these days, so chances are you have a USB port in the back of your TV, that is another convienent option for you. I use this option.
(It can turn on and off with your TV)
(3). You can simply use an adapter to plug into the wall, but you’ll have to remember to turn it off and on manually.

3. Fan placements:
(The side that blows out is the side where the wire is visible)
The placements I personally recommend and use myself (pictured) is one fan on the bottom holding up the PS4, blowing UP onto the bottom of the PS4 and one fan sitting on top blowing DOWN onto the PS4.
Creating an external fan sandwich.
Having the PS4 lifted will also allow the bottom to get some proper air flow.
(I found a foam and plastic piece that I placed under the front of the PS4 as well, just to make sure the PS4 sits comfortably & with better balance.. I’d recommend something like that too).

Side note: if you’re gonna set it up like this, put something under the feet of the fans if you’re placing it on wood.. Otherwise, it could leave light rings in the wood from the pressure.

Alternative placements:
(1). You can sit up one of the fans so it blows right into the vents on the right side of the PS4, this’ll help get cold air into your PS4. Not a bad option.
(2). You can also sit up a fan at the back of the PS4 (where air escapes from the system), blowing air AWAY from the PS4 - helping suck the air out.
But honestly, i think the other methods are more effective. I’d probably only recommend this one if your PS4 is in an enclosed area and you want to help the hot air escape from the area (like fan cutouts at the back of your enclosed area). Otherwise, the other methods work better in my experience.

1127,1188,1188,Awesome fans for cooling random devices that are fan-less.,"I bought these fans to cool my 700 watt surround sound system receiver that produces a lot of heat, so this review will be in depth and thorough. I ran two tests, the first with the receiver on top of the cabinet with open airflow, and the second inside the cabinet with closed airflow. I will also use an Infrared Laser thermometer to test temperatures inside of the receiver, from whence the heat is created and is at its hottest, especially on heat sinks and chips. My receiver is vented all over the top and bottom so peeking through isn't a problem.

Test 1 - For test one the receiver will sit on top of the cabinet with open airflow. Since heat rises i have placed the fans on top of the receiver blowing upwards since there is no room underneath it and the weight of it will crush these two fans even though they are built pretty tough. With no fans my receiver idles around 150 F and at loud volume rises to 200ish F. That's just too much. Now i throw in the dual AC Infinity fans and start them out at low and move to medium and them high, taking temperatures as i go. On low speed, temperatures only came down to about 190 F, so still no cigar. On medium i got more result, down to 150 F, which is what i call the green zone. And on high, the temps came down to a whopping 98 F. Also, the only time i could hear noise from the fans was on high, so they are indeed quiet and powerful. The static pressure wasn't bad either, i have more powerful inside my PC but you can actually feel some air coming from these.

Test 2 - For test two the receiver went inside the cabinet. I expected results to be worse in there due to the restriction of airflow but i was surprised. With the fans in the same place i started with low speed and measured 180 F inside the receiver. I'm guessing the fans get better directional airflow inside a cabinet without things like a ceiling fan interfering. Medium speed is where it got interesting, 125 F is what i measured from the laser. And then on high speed, i measured a chilling 88 F on the heat sink around the power supply inside the receiver, usually the hottest spot i can point at with the laser. Very impeccable results. The only thing is that after 30 - 45 minutes there is a build up of heat inside my entertainment cabinet, so must leave the glass door open for heat to escape while in use, but now i wont haft to worry about it catching fire.

Conclusion - Totally awesome fans. Their performance is impeccable. Also, they construction is very very solid and nice. If my reciever was just a little smaller and lighter i could sit it on top of these and have them blowing from the bottom. The grills are child finger proof and easy to clean, and the wiring and switch has nice thick cable and strong plastic. And the extra female USB port is great for when you need that third fan, or another set of AC Infinity fans. The only thing i could see improving here, other than the obvious like RPM's and static pressure, is making a true AC wall jack powered version of these with the double - triple - quadruple fan setup for devices that don't have USB ports. I know AC Inf. makes AC powered fans but they're all singles. Need multiples! I would highly recommend tese fans to anyone who needs extra cooling for their non-desktop PC electronic devices.

1128,1189,1189,"UPDATE: Just Repurchased! Works great, very quiet, no vibration","2/11/2021 UPDATE! Just reordered another S7 pair of fans! Andy, I have never met you, but I sure like these quiet fans and continue to recommend these!

I have three of these fans in a media closet that is about the size of a tall refrigerator. Inside on shelves I have a high-powered AV receiver, a BluRay player, a Cable TV DVR, and other stuff that is producing an amazing amount of heat. When we built the house the wife wanted all AV equipment hidden, and as an Audiophile I wanted to be able to see what I want to see and hear what I want to hear in the Home theater seating area, but without any extraneous noise.

Solution: I bought this item, and set two fans on top of the AV Receiver and a third identical fan on top of the cable box/DVR. Closed the door and waited an hour. Heat load dropped in half. I did not want to just move a hot air around in this large closet, so there is a passive vent installed in the sealing of the closet .... just a simple louvered floor vent like people have in their homes for floor heat. I just waited until the wife unit was out of the house and used one of her good steak knives to saw a hole in the drywall ceiling a drop this Lower cheap floor vent in:) Vacuum the mess up and done. These fans have been running flawlessly for two years now - and my wife, who could hear a mouse fart, has never noticed them.

Quality/overall impression: Frankly, I thought these were two cheap to be really durable, but I bought them because at the time they were one of the few USB fan setups with a speed controller, no fan-boi disco light show LEDs, and with a CEC rating. The fans are very quiet, well-made, and have nice rubber anti-vibration feet.

I was nervous about leaving cheap fans on 24-7 because the last thing I want to do is have a house fire because the units were wired up by orphaned slave labor recruited from a deplorable third world slum. But those fears were immediately put out of mind when I opened the box upon receipt. Beautiful packing, high quality wiring and fan construction.

I am back on their site today reordering a second set to place on my desktop next to my computer workstation. I have a couple of good friends who work designing high end consumer electronics - the really pricy stuff. Both techs told me that placing a good quality cooling fan on an AV receiver can add several years working lifetime to such units.

Therefore, I highly recommend these AC Infinity products. Just buy the dual fan setup, set the speed controller wherever you are comfortable and forget about them! (slower is a little quieter, but even on high these were very acceptable for my application) And like I said, I am back today repurchasing another set, which I should have done long ago:)  Heat kills electronics. And if you are checking out cooling fans, you already know that stereos, AV equipment and computer gear can generate enough heat to slowly nuke your gear...

Next possible project for these.... We have a couple of large walk in closets, which we keep the doors closed on because our ever-curious weenie dogs like to curl up in when we are not home. Anyway, I put the old computer fans, which were too noisy, in the closets to keep the air circulating and not smelling musty when we have been gone for awhile. One of these small fans would be much quieter, and would be strong enough to push all the air it needs to under the closet door to keep things smelling fresh in there - even after we have returned from a couple weeks vacation.",5,B00JLV4BWC,"2/11/2021 UPDATE!

1129,1190,1190,Decent functionality for the price. Installing was a pain.,"I use these fans daily to cool my PC cabinet while gaming. For the price they work as expected, not super powerful but they get the job done better than nothing. Super easy to use after installation, just plug into a USB port and turn them on. Quiet enough that they aren't super noticable, I can say they're pretty durable as they've survived my cat sticking his claws into them multiple times. Cord length is all right but not great.

Where I start to have issue was with the installation. Some hardware was provided (shallow screws and rubber grommets installed as pictured and a couple zip ties), but ultimately it was difficult to make it work with the provided hardware. The other issue I ran into is if you unscrew the mounting screws and rubber grommets it also detaches the back grate, so in order to get it mounted you have to try to line up the grate and the fan in a cabinet you may not be able to reach both sides of. Once you do get it mounted the screws are too shallow to go through any material that's thicker than sheet metal really.

1130,1191,1191,Can I give them 6 stars?,"TLDR: Great for cooling PS5 (or any console I'd wager).  VERY quiet.  STURDY fan casing, NOT cheap flimsy plastic.

These are absolutely brilliant.  These are one of those things that you normally imagine would be really great, then you get them and they are garbage.  However, they wound up being exactly what I hoped and honestly a little better.

The first we noticed when pulling them out of the box was thickness of the plastic that the fan casing is molded out of.  It's definitely not thin or cheap plastic.  It definitely has a bit of weight to it.

After plugging them in, my wife and I were both a little shocked on how darn quite they were.  My wife is super sensitive to stuff that borders on what I'd call ""white noise"" type noises especially from fans and the like, so they easily checked the super quiet box.

The rubber feet on them make it so they don't really rattle or vibrate if you set them on a flat surface and they are legitimate 120mm fans so you can also just mount them to the back of a cabinet if you're trying to blow cool air into a small cubby where you have a console situated or move the hot air out.

The ability to control the fan speed with the Lo/Med/High/Off settings is great.  We usually just leave them on and let them turn on whenever the console comes on.

The last thing that I'd call an added bonus is that they have an extra USB port on the cabling for the fans.  This alleviates the need to actually ""sacrifice"" a USB port to use the fans.

Full disclosure... we also purchased the 80mm version of these and hated them.  The airflow was insufficient for our needs and for whatever reason they really were louder even though they should not have been.

1131,1192,1192,Reduced the temperatures on my router from 92c to 64c.,"Our home has a Linksys WRT32X wireless router which is passively cooled, meaning that there is only a large heatsink without a cooling fan. While this is great for absolute silence, it does affect temperatures quite a bit. I have installed OpenWRT on the WRT32X for more control and features over the router and this includes temperature monitoring. On idle, the router stays at 92c in an ambient of 30. Take note, the router is placed in the open in the TV console, so it's not like it is closed up in a cabinet with zero ventilation. On maximum load tests, it can reach a maximum of around 110c (!!). Temperatures like this would significantly affect the lifespan of electronics so I am compelled to do something about it.

Here is where I decided to get these cooling fans to help reduce temperatures to more sensible levels. I wasn't expecting what a difference it could make. I simply placed the fan on the top of the router where it sucks out the hot air from the router. Idle temperatures dropped from 92c to 64c. You can take a look at the temperature graph I have included. You can see when I plugged it in and the temperatures starting to decline gradually. I tried reversing the orientation of the fan such that it blows cool air into the router instead of sucking hot air out of it, but there didn't seem to be much difference, so I just let it suck the hot air out.

The fans themselves are very easy to use. It is powered by a USB port, and the router conveniently has a USB port that I'm not using otherwise, so I plugged in the fan there. There is also an inline speed controller that allows you to set it to off, low, medium and high. I noticed that if I set it on low, the controller gets just a little warm, while on high it is cool. I'm guessing there's some kind of resistor in there that reduces the speed of the fan by diverting some of the electrical power to heat instead. Speaking of the fan speed, even on the high setting, it is still fairly quiet and moves a generous amount of air per fan. The fans come in a set of two, so I'm using one for the router, and the other for general ventilation to keep air moving around. The fans themselves have rubber feet and a metal grating in front to prevent accidental contact with the fan blades. The rubber feet also provids  some distance between the fan and the device it is cooling so that air can pass through more easily.

I have 4 intake with small filters and 2 exhaust.

The controller does an amazing job of controlling these fans via its ""smart"" setting. Where the fans start at low speed when the cabinet reaches 95 degrees and then full speed or high when the temp reaches 105.

The fans are nearly unnoticeable in the first setting, barely noticed at their medium setting and slightly audible from my gaming positing near the cabinet at high.

They cool my Xbox and internet modem adequately and have actually reduced a lot of the thermal throttling I witnessed when playing prior to install.

The Xbox used to sit on top of the cabinet collecting lots of dust, now it has stayed clean for quite some time, with regular use, and my games run more smoothly than ever before.

It's quite enjoyable to see the cabinet turn off on its own, and only begin ramping up with a load on the Xbox.

I understand this lock is intended to keep all setting such as pin codes, fingerprints, settings store local (which is a plus); sadly it does not appear to integrate with anything - no Google Home, no Home Assistant, nothing.  It's not a connected device which makes it virtually useless with smart home integration.  I’m not sure why they are considering this a smart lock.

I appreciate this lock coming with a physical key.  However, it would be nice if you could re-key the lock so it matches the other keys for my other locks.  Not a fan of needing to carry around another key just for this one lock.

Finally, and this is the reason I likely won’t continue using this lock, I feel like the product is made out of too much plastic, especially the part that faces the outside.  I'm relatively confident I could break into my house by smashing the lock from the outside which would provide easy access to the inner mechanism for the physical key.

1188,1257,1257,PRO tips for the PS4 PRO,"These fans are great for ensuring circulation, cooling, and minimizing fan noise for your PS4.
I’ll list some PRO TIPS below (pun intended).

READ BELOW FOR THE TIPS.

Though it’s completely normal for your PS4 to get medium-hot, it never hurts to maximize cooling for any electronic... ESPECIALLY in enclosed places.

When the system is cooler, the internal fan don’t need to work as hard, maximizing efficiency and naturally prolonging the life expectancy and overall reducing its noise.

These fans are super quiet and by keeping the system cool, the internal fans don’t need to work half as hard, thus reducing overall noise significantly... Which is a great bonus.

With these fans on high setting, placed like in my photos, my PS4 never exceeds a mild warmth.

These fans are versatile, allowing you to link more fans if you’d like, and allowing you to set them up however you’d like depending on your setting.

NOW FOR THE TIPS:

1. Do this first!
You’re probably aiming to reduce noise and/or keep the system as cool as possible, so I’d HIGHLY recommend to begin by dusting out the internal fan just for the added benefit. It’s very simple with the PS4 PRO. Simply pop off the top cover and air dust or lightly wipe off the fans and place the cover back in. (Refer to how-to videos online). This’ll keep the internal fans running efficiently.

2. USB tips:
(1). There is a hidden USB port in the BACK of the PS4 PRO use that one to keep it out of the way and to leave your front two USB ports free.
(It can turn on and off with your PS4)
(2). You’re likely using a 4K TV or any TV with many ports these days, so chances are you have a USB port in the back of your TV, that is another convienent option for you. I use this option.
(It can turn on and off with your TV)
(3). You can simply use an adapter to plug into the wall, but you’ll have to remember to turn it off and on manually.

3. Fan placements:
(The side that blows out is the side where the wire is visible)
The placements I personally recommend and use myself (pictured) is one fan on the bottom holding up the PS4, blowing UP onto the bottom of the PS4 and one fan sitting on top blowing DOWN onto the PS4.
Creating an external fan sandwich.
Having the PS4 lifted will also allow the bottom to get some proper air flow.
(I found a foam and plastic piece that I placed under the front of the PS4 as well, just to make sure the PS4 sits comfortably & with better balance.. I’d recommend something like that too).

Side note: if you’re gonna set it up like this, put something under the feet of the fans if you’re placing it on wood.. Otherwise, it could leave light rings in the wood from the pressure.

Alternative placements:
(1). You can sit up one of the fans so it blows right into the vents on the right side of the PS4, this’ll help get cold air into your PS4. Not a bad option.
(2). You can also sit up a fan at the back of the PS4 (where air escapes from the system), blowing air AWAY from the PS4 - helping suck the air out.
But honestly, i think the other methods are more effective. I’d probably only recommend this one if your PS4 is in an enclosed area and you want to help the hot air escape from the area (like fan cutouts at the back of your enclosed area). Otherwise, the other methods work better in my experience.

1189,1258,1258,Awesome fans for cooling random devices that are fan-less.,"I bought these fans to cool my 700 watt surround sound system receiver that produces a lot of heat, so this review will be in depth and thorough. I ran two tests, the first with the receiver on top of the cabinet with open airflow, and the second inside the cabinet with closed airflow. I will also use an Infrared Laser thermometer to test temperatures inside of the receiver, from whence the heat is created and is at its hottest, especially on heat sinks and chips. My receiver is vented all over the top and bottom so peeking through isn't a problem.

Test 1 - For test one the receiver will sit on top of the cabinet with open airflow. Since heat rises i have placed the fans on top of the receiver blowing upwards since there is no room underneath it and the weight of it will crush these two fans even though they are built pretty tough. With no fans my receiver idles around 150 F and at loud volume rises to 200ish F. That's just too much. Now i throw in the dual AC Infinity fans and start them out at low and move to medium and them high, taking temperatures as i go. On low speed, temperatures only came down to about 190 F, so still no cigar. On medium i got more result, down to 150 F, which is what i call the green zone. And on high, the temps came down to a whopping 98 F. Also, the only time i could hear noise from the fans was on high, so they are indeed quiet and powerful. The static pressure wasn't bad either, i have more powerful inside my PC but you can actually feel some air coming from these.

Test 2 - For test two the receiver went inside the cabinet. I expected results to be worse in there due to the restriction of airflow but i was surprised. With the fans in the same place i started with low speed and measured 180 F inside the receiver. I'm guessing the fans get better directional airflow inside a cabinet without things like a ceiling fan interfering. Medium speed is where it got interesting, 125 F is what i measured from the laser. And then on high speed, i measured a chilling 88 F on the heat sink around the power supply inside the receiver, usually the hottest spot i can point at with the laser. Very impeccable results. The only thing is that after 30 - 45 minutes there is a build up of heat inside my entertainment cabinet, so must leave the glass door open for heat to escape while in use, but now i wont haft to worry about it catching fire.

Conclusion - Totally awesome fans. Their performance is impeccable. Also, they construction is very very solid and nice. If my reciever was just a little smaller and lighter i could sit it on top of these and have them blowing from the bottom. The grills are child finger proof and easy to clean, and the wiring and switch has nice thick cable and strong plastic. And the extra female USB port is great for when you need that third fan, or another set of AC Infinity fans. The only thing i could see improving here, other than the obvious like RPM's and static pressure, is making a true AC wall jack powered version of these with the double - triple - quadruple fan setup for devices that don't have USB ports. I know AC Inf. makes AC powered fans but they're all singles. Need multiples! I would highly recommend tese fans to anyone who needs extra cooling for their non-desktop PC electronic devices.

1190,1259,1259,"UPDATE: Just Repurchased! Works great, very quiet, no vibration","2/11/2021 UPDATE! Just reordered another S7 pair of fans! Andy, I have never met you, but I sure like these quiet fans and continue to recommend these!

I have three of these fans in a media closet that is about the size of a tall refrigerator. Inside on shelves I have a high-powered AV receiver, a BluRay player, a Cable TV DVR, and other stuff that is producing an amazing amount of heat. When we built the house the wife wanted all AV equipment hidden, and as an Audiophile I wanted to be able to see what I want to see and hear what I want to hear in the Home theater seating area, but without any extraneous noise.

Solution: I bought this item, and set two fans on top of the AV Receiver and a third identical fan on top of the cable box/DVR. Closed the door and waited an hour. Heat load dropped in half. I did not want to just move a hot air around in this large closet, so there is a passive vent installed in the sealing of the closet .... just a simple louvered floor vent like people have in their homes for floor heat. I just waited until the wife unit was out of the house and used one of her good steak knives to saw a hole in the drywall ceiling a drop this Lower cheap floor vent in:) Vacuum the mess up and done. These fans have been running flawlessly for two years now - and my wife, who could hear a mouse fart, has never noticed them.

Quality/overall impression: Frankly, I thought these were two cheap to be really durable, but I bought them because at the time they were one of the few USB fan setups with a speed controller, no fan-boi disco light show LEDs, and with a CEC rating. The fans are very quiet, well-made, and have nice rubber anti-vibration feet.

I was nervous about leaving cheap fans on 24-7 because the last thing I want to do is have a house fire because the units were wired up by orphaned slave labor recruited from a deplorable third world slum. But those fears were immediately put out of mind when I opened the box upon receipt. Beautiful packing, high quality wiring and fan construction.

I am back on their site today reordering a second set to place on my desktop next to my computer workstation. I have a couple of good friends who work designing high end consumer electronics - the really pricy stuff. Both techs told me that placing a good quality cooling fan on an AV receiver can add several years working lifetime to such units.

Therefore, I highly recommend these AC Infinity products. Just buy the dual fan setup, set the speed controller wherever you are comfortable and forget about them! (slower is a little quieter, but even on high these were very acceptable for my application) And like I said, I am back today repurchasing another set, which I should have done long ago:)  Heat kills electronics. And if you are checking out cooling fans, you already know that stereos, AV equipment and computer gear can generate enough heat to slowly nuke your gear...

Next possible project for these.... We have a couple of large walk in closets, which we keep the doors closed on because our ever-curious weenie dogs like to curl up in when we are not home. Anyway, I put the old computer fans, which were too noisy, in the closets to keep the air circulating and not smelling musty when we have been gone for awhile. One of these small fans would be much quieter, and would be strong enough to push all the air it needs to under the closet door to keep things smelling fresh in there - even after we have returned from a couple weeks vacation.",5,B00JLV4BWC,"2/11/2021 UPDATE!

1191,1260,1260,Decent functionality for the price. Installing was a pain.,"I use these fans daily to cool my PC cabinet while gaming. For the price they work as expected, not super powerful but they get the job done better than nothing. Super easy to use after installation, just plug into a USB port and turn them on. Quiet enough that they aren't super noticable, I can say they're pretty durable as they've survived my cat sticking his claws into them multiple times. Cord length is all right but not great.

Where I start to have issue was with the installation. Some hardware was provided (shallow screws and rubber grommets installed as pictured and a couple zip ties), but ultimately it was difficult to make it work with the provided hardware. The other issue I ran into is if you unscrew the mounting screws and rubber grommets it also detaches the back grate, so in order to get it mounted you have to try to line up the grate and the fan in a cabinet you may not be able to reach both sides of. Once you do get it mounted the screws are too shallow to go through any material that's thicker than sheet metal really.

1192,1261,1261,Can I give them 6 stars?,"TLDR: Great for cooling PS5 (or any console I'd wager).  VERY quiet.  STURDY fan casing, NOT cheap flimsy plastic.

These are absolutely brilliant.  These are one of those things that you normally imagine would be really great, then you get them and they are garbage.  However, they wound up being exactly what I hoped and honestly a little better.

The first we noticed when pulling them out of the box was thickness of the plastic that the fan casing is molded out of.  It's definitely not thin or cheap plastic.  It definitely has a bit of weight to it.

After plugging them in, my wife and I were both a little shocked on how darn quite they were.  My wife is super sensitive to stuff that borders on what I'd call ""white noise"" type noises especially from fans and the like, so they easily checked the super quiet box.

The rubber feet on them make it so they don't really rattle or vibrate if you set them on a flat surface and they are legitimate 120mm fans so you can also just mount them to the back of a cabinet if you're trying to blow cool air into a small cubby where you have a console situated or move the hot air out.

The ability to control the fan speed with the Lo/Med/High/Off settings is great.  We usually just leave them on and let them turn on whenever the console comes on.

The last thing that I'd call an added bonus is that they have an extra USB port on the cabling for the fans.  This alleviates the need to actually ""sacrifice"" a USB port to use the fans.

Full disclosure... we also purchased the 80mm version of these and hated them.  The airflow was insufficient for our needs and for whatever reason they really were louder even though they should not have been.

1193,1262,1262,Reduced the temperatures on my router from 92c to 64c.,"Our home has a Linksys WRT32X wireless router which is passively cooled, meaning that there is only a large heatsink without a cooling fan. While this is great for absolute silence, it does affect temperatures quite a bit. I have installed OpenWRT on the WRT32X for more control and features over the router and this includes temperature monitoring. On idle, the router stays at 92c in an ambient of 30. Take note, the router is placed in the open in the TV console, so it's not like it is closed up in a cabinet with zero ventilation. On maximum load tests, it can reach a maximum of around 110c (!!). Temperatures like this would significantly affect the lifespan of electronics so I am compelled to do something about it.

Here is where I decided to get these cooling fans to help reduce temperatures to more sensible levels. I wasn't expecting what a difference it could make. I simply placed the fan on the top of the router where it sucks out the hot air from the router. Idle temperatures dropped from 92c to 64c. You can take a look at the temperature graph I have included. You can see when I plugged it in and the temperatures starting to decline gradually. I tried reversing the orientation of the fan such that it blows cool air into the router instead of sucking hot air out of it, but there didn't seem to be much difference, so I just let it suck the hot air out.

The fans themselves are very easy to use. It is powered by a USB port, and the router conveniently has a USB port that I'm not using otherwise, so I plugged in the fan there. There is also an inline speed controller that allows you to set it to off, low, medium and high. I noticed that if I set it on low, the controller gets just a little warm, while on high it is cool. I'm guessing there's some kind of resistor in there that reduces the speed of the fan by diverting some of the electrical power to heat instead. Speaking of the fan speed, even on the high setting, it is still fairly quiet and moves a generous amount of air per fan. The fans come in a set of two, so I'm using one for the router, and the other for general ventilation to keep air moving around. The fans themselves have rubber feet and a metal grating in front to prevent accidental contact with the fan blades. The rubber feet also provids  some distance between the fan and the device it is cooling so that air can pass through more easily.

1194,1263,1263,"High quality,  moves lots of air - save your electronics.","This fan was pretty much what the doctor ordered for my Pioneer Elite SC25. After 6 years of ownership it had developed a shutting on and off issue which was intermittent but the last year the issue really worsenned and would not stay on for longer than 30 minutes or so. I was hunting for a replacement but finding the feature set of that receiver with a class D amp is merely impossible under 3k these days. I use this amp for 2.1 channel sound at high volumes. I bought this multifan S7 from AC Infinity as a last effort to salvage it (amazing sound) and save me some coin and the S7 does the job. I have placed one fan blowing in and one out and it keeps the receiver way cooler. No shutting down issues after about 5 hours of testing with up to 2 continuous hours of use. Needless to say I am very happy and richer as I was willing to spend a large amount of cash to replicate the sound of the sc25. Definitely give this a try if you have cooling needs. Also use it even if you don't becuase it is a preventive measure to cooking your electronics (as i likely did)  prematurely and potentially shortening its life. The design of these things by the way is solid, nothing cheap here. Fan is way quiet and throws a lot of air. It is also efficient, the speed selector works well (and makes a difference) and gets powered by the USB plug on the receiver itself which is always powered!

1228,1300,1300,A valuable addition to the bookshelf: worth the time and the money,"Platt's 'Enc. of Electronic Components' is a good read, lots of information on the components covered, and strikes a fine balance between underwhelming the knowledgeable and overwhelming those who 'just don't know.'

I wanted to know more about capacitors. Now I have read why I might choose polyethylene over mylar, or tantalum caps over electrolytics. I wanted to know more about coils, inductors, and now there is a little more knowledge to fill the wells of memory there as well.

Lots of good information on resistors, capacitors (including the actual schematics for RC high and low pass filters), a little later there are LCR filters, diodes, a variety of diodes and transistor types. There is a very good section on a variety of motors - better here than I expected, so I learned more where I hadn't thought I would.

Platt introduces the volume by suggesting the book will gather enough information to be usable, in one place, effectively 'peer reviewed' for accuracy and legitimacy, and the book certainly lives up to that aim.

In all chapters on components there is a 'what could go wrong' section; that is what I'm going to add here. My two big complaints have to do with typeface/font selection and the layout of illustrations. The font used for formulae I find hard to read quickly and accurately. Most troublesome is the 'pi' symbol which quite often I mistake for an 'n' which I catch because I know the equation - but I can see being caught out. That I would like to see changed. The other complaint is the number of times throughout the book where the text refers to an illustration -- which is on the next page. It sounds like a minor complaint but can be irritating.

Those two quibbles aside I'm glad I bought the book. If my bookshelf had a fire, earthquake, tsunami, or house-cleaner come through I would buy another copy quickly.

And, once through the first couple chapters, I want to know when the next (two!) volumes are coming out?

1231,1303,1303,Too much detail on simple things not enough on hard things,"This book is great as an introduction into Electronics. I think it's useful to have around in case you ever want to look anything up but I was under the assumption it would be more encyclopedic whereas this is sort of like a 6th graders reference book for not any sort of actual practical referencing but just something need to look at in read. There are some chapters that are incredibly long on things like relays that, while correct and useful to people who use a lot of relays, are incredibly boring for 90% of the people that are going to be reading this book. Relay is a great device if you're making an oven but if you're making an oven you're not reading this book. That is to say, the writer is very intelligent as far as electrical engineering goes however the writer is not cognizant of who he is writing to, he switches between thinking his audiences incredibly developed in their Electronics knowledge and thinking that his audience knows nothing about Electronics. For example, the DC motor and AC motor section is the majority of the book. I mean not exactly but it's very long however a DC motor has two connectors and we all know how to wire it up to get it to work it's the simplest electronic component in the world. The mosfet is given 2 pages and is lumped in with the JFET, and enhancement mode, depletion mode, and channel, P Channel, the various regions, and it's applications (of which the P Channel mosfet application listed was something like ""no one uses p channel mosfets"") are zoomed through. The incongruity there being that the mosfet is very likely the most used electronic component in history and the relay is giving much more detail.

however I got this book when I didn't know s*** about electronics and now I do so maybe I can sound all high-and-mighty like this because I read the book and having read the book I Now understand Electronics. It's a chicken or the egg kind of thing. But this is a genuine review and if this is what you want, and I'm sure it is, then you should buy the book because I did and now I know electronics well enough to write a review ragging on this book (chicken/egg

~ Walker's Walkie Talkie (WT) attachment (ASIN: B07QFCP93T; item model number: GWP-RZRWT; price on 2015/05/23: $26.20; price today: $28.99 down from $49.99)

I've used the Howard Leight Impact Sport (HLIS) electronic earmuffs for years, so some portion of this review will be in comparison to the HL.

The Walker's RSEM is very similar to HLIS in design and in function. The headband, the muffs, and the general construction is very similar as if they copied each other's design.

The RSEM (just like the HLIS) has a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of low to mid 20s. For hearing protection while shooting, I don't consider 20 dB of reduction to be adequate, and I usually wear NRR 30 disposable foam earplugs under the muffs. Because the amplified electronic earmuff volume can be turned up, NRR 30 earplugs would be fine to wear underneath. In a traditional non-electronic earmuff, wearing foam ear plugs underneath maybe too much attenuation if you want to have a conversation with someone.

The RSEM (just like the HLIS) has a slim design. Collapsed, they are moderately compact, and do not take up a lot of space in the shooting bag.

The RSEM (just like the HLIS) has an auxiliary headphone jack, so you can plug in an audio plug to listen to music, or use this jack to plug in a two way radio attachment. Walker's makes the WT attachment which is affordable and easy to use. Meanwhile, I'm not able to easily find a simple solution for the lay shooter using the HLIS.

There is no active noise cancellation, however, I've could say this offers active noise reduction with passive nose isolation; noise isolation from the ear muffs, and nose reduction from the microcircuit that selectively amplifies ambient noise except for loud noises.

The RSEM comes in many colors and designs, and while they retail for $79.99 on Amazon, some can be found on sale for around $32. It's hard to find them all and compare priceson Amazon because they're not all on the same Amazon page. Currently, it looks like the Razor Tacti-Grip Slim Electronic muff (ASIN: B08LXS9B9M; item model number: GWP-RSEMRH) is the least expensive at $34.45.

The Howard Leight does offer some color and design options, but far fewer than Walker's does. These retail for $90 to $110 on Amazon, and some can be found as low as $60.

The RSEM (just like the HLIS) is not that comfortable to wear, but it's tolerable for a few hours. They can be worn over a baseball cap. They won't fit very well over a normal thickness beanie.

Now, onto the Walker's WT attachment. This is thing that sets the RSEM apart from the HLIS. This attachment is affordable, easy to install, easy to use, and requires no other equipment. (In contrast, I did come across two way radio adapters that turn a handheld radio and the HLIS into a communication device, but that's not quite affordable or easy to use.)

After I installed three AAA batteries into the WT attachment, I attached it to the RSEM. The instructions didn't mention removing the rubber cap to the headphone jack, but I felt this was necessary for a good fit. I was initially unable to hear any received transmission. After a few moments, I found that this was because the WT attachment didn't fit onto the muff very well, and the plug wasn't fully seated into the jack. With some force, I was able to mate the WT attachment to the RSEM, and was able to hear received transmission.

The mic seems a little short, but it picks up well even with VOX. Three is a little bit of delay from the time I start speaking until VOX turns l activates, but the solution is to talk like an airline pilot. ""Uhhhhhhhh, this is your captain speaking...."" The only adjustments to the VOX sensitivity is ""HI"" or ""LO,"" so fine tuning may be necessary to talk louder or softer, or adjust the microphone placement away or closer to the mouth. I wish it had infinite sensitivity adjustment using a dial.

Being able to use the full list of 22 FRS frequencies is nice, unlike cheap walkie talkies that only offer 10 or so. The priority channel feature nice and could come in handy at a large event when users on different frequencies: this is basically a scam feature. The audio quality is OK, but this is a $50 toy radio, I guess.

The 99 sub channels are not really sub channels, but by using CTCSS, transmission from radios not using the same CTCSS is not heard on the handset. Wikipedia has a good explanation:
""CTCSS tone codes are sometimes referred to as sub-channels, but this is a misnomer because no additional radio channels are created. All users with different CTCSS tones on the same channel are still transmitting on the identical radio frequency, and their transmissions interfere with each other; however; the interference is masked under most conditions. Although it provides some protection against interference, CTCSS does not offer any security against interception or jamming, and receivers without CTCSS enabled will still hear all traffic.""

Being an FRS radio, if you use this in a busy area, you may unfortunately have to hunt for an open frequency.

My only concern with the WT attachment is wether the WT attachment would stay properly mated to the RSEM during movements. I can pull on the bottom of the WT attachment and partially unplug it moderately easily even with the top clamp on. It may be that the plastic moulding of the RSEM or WT attachment is inconsistent, and some reshaping or modification is needed. I'll continue to monitor, and see if I can identify an easy solution.

Overall, this is a great solution for on the shooting range.",4,B076HG138S,"This review two related items: ~ Walker's Razor Slim Electronic Muff (RSEM) light teal color (ASIN: B076HG138S; item model number: GWP-RSEM-LTL; price 2025/05/23: $32.79; price 2025/05/30: $46.46) ~ Walker's Walkie Talkie (WT) attachment (ASIN: B07QFCP93T; item model number: GWP-RZRWT; price 2015/05/23: $26.20; price today: $28.99 $49.99) I've used Howard Leight Impact Sport (HLIS) electronic earmuffs years, portion review comparison HL.

1302,1380,1380,A valuable addition to the bookshelf: worth the time and the money,"Platt's 'Enc. of Electronic Components' is a good read, lots of information on the components covered, and strikes a fine balance between underwhelming the knowledgeable and overwhelming those who 'just don't know.'

I wanted to know more about capacitors. Now I have read why I might choose polyethylene over mylar, or tantalum caps over electrolytics. I wanted to know more about coils, inductors, and now there is a little more knowledge to fill the wells of memory there as well.

Lots of good information on resistors, capacitors (including the actual schematics for RC high and low pass filters), a little later there are LCR filters, diodes, a variety of diodes and transistor types. There is a very good section on a variety of motors - better here than I expected, so I learned more where I hadn't thought I would.

Platt introduces the volume by suggesting the book will gather enough information to be usable, in one place, effectively 'peer reviewed' for accuracy and legitimacy, and the book certainly lives up to that aim.

In all chapters on components there is a 'what could go wrong' section; that is what I'm going to add here. My two big complaints have to do with typeface/font selection and the layout of illustrations. The font used for formulae I find hard to read quickly and accurately. Most troublesome is the 'pi' symbol which quite often I mistake for an 'n' which I catch because I know the equation - but I can see being caught out. That I would like to see changed. The other complaint is the number of times throughout the book where the text refers to an illustration -- which is on the next page. It sounds like a minor complaint but can be irritating.

Those two quibbles aside I'm glad I bought the book. If my bookshelf had a fire, earthquake, tsunami, or house-cleaner come through I would buy another copy quickly.

And, once through the first couple chapters, I want to know when the next (two!) volumes are coming out?

1305,1383,1383,Too much detail on simple things not enough on hard things,"This book is great as an introduction into Electronics. I think it's useful to have around in case you ever want to look anything up but I was under the assumption it would be more encyclopedic whereas this is sort of like a 6th graders reference book for not any sort of actual practical referencing but just something need to look at in read. There are some chapters that are incredibly long on things like relays that, while correct and useful to people who use a lot of relays, are incredibly boring for 90% of the people that are going to be reading this book. Relay is a great device if you're making an oven but if you're making an oven you're not reading this book. That is to say, the writer is very intelligent as far as electrical engineering goes however the writer is not cognizant of who he is writing to, he switches between thinking his audiences incredibly developed in their Electronics knowledge and thinking that his audience knows nothing about Electronics. For example, the DC motor and AC motor section is the majority of the book. I mean not exactly but it's very long however a DC motor has two connectors and we all know how to wire it up to get it to work it's the simplest electronic component in the world. The mosfet is given 2 pages and is lumped in with the JFET, and enhancement mode, depletion mode, and channel, P Channel, the various regions, and it's applications (of which the P Channel mosfet application listed was something like ""no one uses p channel mosfets"") are zoomed through. The incongruity there being that the mosfet is very likely the most used electronic component in history and the relay is giving much more detail.

however I got this book when I didn't know s*** about electronics and now I do so maybe I can sound all high-and-mighty like this because I read the book and having read the book I Now understand Electronics. It's a chicken or the egg kind of thing. But this is a genuine review and if this is what you want, and I'm sure it is, then you should buy the book because I did and now I know electronics well enough to write a review ragging on this book (chicken/egg

1318,1398,1398,The Cloth is Just as Important as the Cleaner,"So: My optometrist's glasses-fitting technicians clean your new glasses with KimWipes, which are these low-abrasion lint-free dry wipes designed for laboratory glassware (and yes, you can get them from amazon!). My optometrist's office also sells their own bottles of eyeglass cleaner which is based on propylene glycol (a.k.a. antifreeze). THAT stuff is pretty expensive, and honestly doesn't work all that well. Instead, I make my own eyeglass cleaner at home with filtered water, isopropyl, and a drop or two of dish soap.

As nicely as the KimWipes, together with my own home-brew isopropyl-based cleaner, works on my eyeglasses, I'm never quite managed to get the same method to give me a perfectly streak-free clean on my laptop and tablet screens.

And that brings us to the MiracleWipes Screen Wipes. They are pre-moistened wipes with, you guessed it, an isopropyl-based cleaning solution. I should say, the wipes are very good. They are just wet enough to nicely clean your screen, but not so wet as to be a risk for device damage. Super!

The MiracleWipes kit, however, ALSO includes a micro-fiber cloth. After you clean your device screen with the wipe(s), you polish it with this cloth, and SHAZAM! -- an absolutely PERFECT, new-out-of-the-box, factory-black display with no streaks, smudges, or blots. In a word, AMAZING.

Clearly, the cloth is the secret sauce.

(And I guess this makes sense. After all, Apple got a lot of notoriety for selling their ridiculous $30 microfiber screen polishing cloth. There must be something to it...)

So, if you get this MiracleWipes screen-cleaning kit, you WILL, absolutely, get terrific results. This product is DEFINITELY recommended!

Sound effects are ok I wouldn't miss it if it didn't have it. Paint has gloss over all the details for so the scuffs are shinny. Tge comfort is also pretty good its not just a crummy hard hat liner.

1329,1413,1413,Awesome Captain Rex helmet!!!!,"In my opinion this helmet is fairly accurate to the Rex in the Ahsoka series.  With that being said only one visual difference I noticed is the weld line above the visor is missing on this helmet but is present in the series. Overall I will be most likely adding said weld line to this helmet as well as adding some better interior fittment pieces (we all know the head band pieces are just uncomfortable).  This helmet is a little bigger than the Mando helmets and even the stormtrooper helmet I have. But if you are a Rex fan even a little I highly recommend buying this helmet it is worth the price whether you use it or you display it. I feel this could have been a 5 star if Hasbro didn’t miss the small detail of the weld line above the visor,  I wish I could have given a 4.5 star review for this overlooked or ignored detail.

1349,1442,1442,"Works Well With My Phone and Laptop Screens, Decent With My TV Screens","We recently bought a couple of TV wall mounts and during the process of getting the TVs mounted, our fingerprint smudges got all over the corners of the screens.  I also have a gaming laptop screen that could use a good cleaning, and my phone screen protector can always use a wipe down at least once a day.  I gave these electronic cleaning wipes a try, and I would say they are a little above average.

These wipes come in packs of 30, and 3 packs came in my order. These have a decent smell to them, they don't have a chemical smell to them, but I do wonder what the cleaning solution is made of.  I see nothing on the seller's page or on the packages that say what it is made from, which is a bit concerning to me.  The wipe cloth itself is thin, so I do double it up when I wipe something.

These cleaning wipes worked well on the screen protector for my phone, and it did a good job on my 17"" laptop screen.  I had brought a package of them to work to use on my three computer monitors, and they did a good job cleaning them up.  I tried these on my 65"" TV that is almost 14 years old, and although I had to press a little harder, the wipes cleaned up the fingerprint smudges on the screen.

It took a few wipes to clean the smudges off, but I didn't want to press too hard on the LED screen.

However, I started having some major issues with it early on. By default, the left and right channels were switched. This made it difficult to enjoy videos/music/games that use stereo audio, particularly ASMR. It took several months before I could figure out how to switch them back through settings on my Macbook. For my PC, I had to keep a software installed just so the audio channels were in the correct output. On top of that, the bluetooth would disconnect frequently and cause the headset to switch off. I stopped using them after the plastic head band broke in half one day. I now use the Logitech G733 headset and it works a hundred times better then this one. Don't be swayed by the low price; you'll find that saving up for a better headset like the G733 will be worth it in the end.",2,B0CDW3LTJT,"I got headset around 3 years ago seemed really good asking price.

I actually bought this to provide power to a small 12v LED set in a piece of art. Fully charged, it works fine for about 2 min, then shuts off.
Reading the manual, I see this is probably a feature in the sellers eyes.
However for my purpose I need this to just stay on until it died, and it does not.
The Led lights should draw constant power, never giving any sign of being ""Fully charged"", so I am not sure how the device is determining it is time to shut off. But nowhere in the description do I see this stated, or I would not have bought it.

I am left with a feeling of this otherwise decent product being mis represented in the listing because they excluded a feature that directly affects the function of the device for the user.
Definitely not an option for powering things like art pieces you are creating.

1395,1490,1490,A valuable addition to the bookshelf: worth the time and the money,"Platt's 'Enc. of Electronic Components' is a good read, lots of information on the components covered, and strikes a fine balance between underwhelming the knowledgeable and overwhelming those who 'just don't know.'

I wanted to know more about capacitors. Now I have read why I might choose polyethylene over mylar, or tantalum caps over electrolytics. I wanted to know more about coils, inductors, and now there is a little more knowledge to fill the wells of memory there as well.

Lots of good information on resistors, capacitors (including the actual schematics for RC high and low pass filters), a little later there are LCR filters, diodes, a variety of diodes and transistor types. There is a very good section on a variety of motors - better here than I expected, so I learned more where I hadn't thought I would.

Platt introduces the volume by suggesting the book will gather enough information to be usable, in one place, effectively 'peer reviewed' for accuracy and legitimacy, and the book certainly lives up to that aim.

In all chapters on components there is a 'what could go wrong' section; that is what I'm going to add here. My two big complaints have to do with typeface/font selection and the layout of illustrations. The font used for formulae I find hard to read quickly and accurately. Most troublesome is the 'pi' symbol which quite often I mistake for an 'n' which I catch because I know the equation - but I can see being caught out. That I would like to see changed. The other complaint is the number of times throughout the book where the text refers to an illustration -- which is on the next page. It sounds like a minor complaint but can be irritating.

Those two quibbles aside I'm glad I bought the book. If my bookshelf had a fire, earthquake, tsunami, or house-cleaner come through I would buy another copy quickly.

And, once through the first couple chapters, I want to know when the next (two!) volumes are coming out?

1398,1493,1493,Too much detail on simple things not enough on hard things,"This book is great as an introduction into Electronics. I think it's useful to have around in case you ever want to look anything up but I was under the assumption it would be more encyclopedic whereas this is sort of like a 6th graders reference book for not any sort of actual practical referencing but just something need to look at in read. There are some chapters that are incredibly long on things like relays that, while correct and useful to people who use a lot of relays, are incredibly boring for 90% of the people that are going to be reading this book. Relay is a great device if you're making an oven but if you're making an oven you're not reading this book. That is to say, the writer is very intelligent as far as electrical engineering goes however the writer is not cognizant of who he is writing to, he switches between thinking his audiences incredibly developed in their Electronics knowledge and thinking that his audience knows nothing about Electronics. For example, the DC motor and AC motor section is the majority of the book. I mean not exactly but it's very long however a DC motor has two connectors and we all know how to wire it up to get it to work it's the simplest electronic component in the world. The mosfet is given 2 pages and is lumped in with the JFET, and enhancement mode, depletion mode, and channel, P Channel, the various regions, and it's applications (of which the P Channel mosfet application listed was something like ""no one uses p channel mosfets"") are zoomed through. The incongruity there being that the mosfet is very likely the most used electronic component in history and the relay is giving much more detail.

however I got this book when I didn't know s*** about electronics and now I do so maybe I can sound all high-and-mighty like this because I read the book and having read the book I Now understand Electronics. It's a chicken or the egg kind of thing. But this is a genuine review and if this is what you want, and I'm sure it is, then you should buy the book because I did and now I know electronics well enough to write a review ragging on this book (chicken/egg

1409,1512,1512,"Works Well With My Phone and Laptop Screens, Decent With My TV Screens","We recently bought a couple of TV wall mounts and during the process of getting the TVs mounted, our fingerprint smudges got all over the corners of the screens.  I also have a gaming laptop screen that could use a good cleaning, and my phone screen protector can always use a wipe down at least once a day.  I gave these electronic cleaning wipes a try, and I would say they are a little above average.

These wipes come in packs of 30, and 3 packs came in my order. These have a decent smell to them, they don't have a chemical smell to them, but I do wonder what the cleaning solution is made of.  I see nothing on the seller's page or on the packages that say what it is made from, which is a bit concerning to me.  The wipe cloth itself is thin, so I do double it up when I wipe something.

These cleaning wipes worked well on the screen protector for my phone, and it did a good job on my 17"" laptop screen.  I had brought a package of them to work to use on my three computer monitors, and they did a good job cleaning them up.  I tried these on my 65"" TV that is almost 14 years old, and although I had to press a little harder, the wipes cleaned up the fingerprint smudges on the screen.  After seeing they worked (but had to put some pressure on them when cleaning) I carefully used them on my newer 75"" TV (5.5 years old). It took a few wipes to clean the smudges off, but I didn't want to press too hard on the LED screen.

Overall these seem to be decent wipes for smaller electronics, but it was a little more tedious to clean the larger TV screens.

But wait, there's a small, annoying LED light from your electronic device flickering persistently. Sounds familiar, right? Well, I stumbled upon a simple yet brilliant solution - stickers!

I'll be honest, initially, I was skeptical. How could something as straightforward as a sticker solve my light pollution woes? But, to my surprise, these stickers are a game-changer. They come in two sheets, offering a variety of sizes and shapes (circle and rectangular) to fit different devices. The package contains both black and white stickers, catering to different surface colors of our various light-emitting devices.

What impressed me the most was their effectiveness. These stickers block 100% of LED lights, and the adhesive strength is remarkable. They stick firmly without leaving any residue when removed. Plus, they are incredibly easy to use – just peel and stick. I’ve used them on my router, printer, and even my laptop charger, and the results are flawless. No more unwanted LED glare!

Another aspect worth mentioning is their versatility. The stickers are not just for nighttime. I found them useful for dimming lights on devices I use during the day, creating a more comfortable and distraction-free environment.

The pack includes two sheets, and the price is a small investment for the comfort and convenience they offer. These stickers have become an essential in my household, and I've even recommended them to friends and family.

1493,1602,1602,Great solution,"This is a review of two related items:
~ Walker's Razor Slim Electronic Muff (RSEM) light teal color (ASIN: B076HG138S; item model number: GWP-RSEM-LTL; price on 2025/05/23: $32.79; price 2025/05/30: $46.46)
~ Walker's Walkie Talkie (WT) attachment (ASIN: B07QFCP93T; item model number: GWP-RZRWT; price on 2015/05/23: $26.20; price today: $28.99 down from $49.99)

I've used the Howard Leight Impact Sport (HLIS) electronic earmuffs for years, so some portion of this review will be in comparison to the HL.

The Walker's RSEM is very similar to HLIS in design and in function. The headband, the muffs, and the general construction is very similar as if they copied each other's design.

The RSEM (just like the HLIS) has a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of low to mid 20s. For hearing protection while shooting, I don't consider 20 dB of reduction to be adequate, and I usually wear NRR 30 disposable foam earplugs under the muffs. Because the amplified electronic earmuff volume can be turned up, NRR 30 earplugs would be fine to wear underneath. In a traditional non-electronic earmuff, wearing foam ear plugs underneath maybe too much attenuation if you want to have a conversation with someone.

The RSEM (just like the HLIS) has a slim design. Collapsed, they are moderately compact, and do not take up a lot of space in the shooting bag.

The RSEM (just like the HLIS) has an auxiliary headphone jack, so you can plug in an audio plug to listen to music, or use this jack to plug in a two way radio attachment. Walker's makes the WT attachment which is affordable and easy to use. Meanwhile, I'm not able to easily find a simple solution for the lay shooter using the HLIS.

There is no active noise cancellation, however, I've could say this offers active noise reduction with passive nose isolation; noise isolation from the ear muffs, and nose reduction from the microcircuit that selectively amplifies ambient noise except for loud noises.

The RSEM comes in many colors and designs, and while they retail for $79.99 on Amazon, some can be found on sale for around $32. It's hard to find them all and compare priceson Amazon because they're not all on the same Amazon page. Currently, it looks like the Razor Tacti-Grip Slim Electronic muff (ASIN: B08LXS9B9M; item model number: GWP-RSEMRH) is the least expensive at $34.45.

The Howard Leight does offer some color and design options, but far fewer than Walker's does. These retail for $90 to $110 on Amazon, and some can be found as low as $60.

The RSEM (just like the HLIS) is not that comfortable to wear, but it's tolerable for a few hours. They can be worn over a baseball cap. They won't fit very well over a normal thickness beanie.

Now, onto the Walker's WT attachment. This is thing that sets the RSEM apart from the HLIS. This attachment is affordable, easy to install, easy to use, and requires no other equipment. (In contrast, I did come across two way radio adapters that turn a handheld radio and the HLIS into a communication device, but that's not quite affordable or easy to use.)

After I installed three AAA batteries into the WT attachment, I attached it to the RSEM. The instructions didn't mention removing the rubber cap to the headphone jack, but I felt this was necessary for a good fit. I was initially unable to hear any received transmission. After a few moments, I found that this was because the WT attachment didn't fit onto the muff very well, and the plug wasn't fully seated into the jack. With some force, I was able to mate the WT attachment to the RSEM, and was able to hear received transmission.

The mic seems a little short, but it picks up well even with VOX. Three is a little bit of delay from the time I start speaking until VOX turns l activates, but the solution is to talk like an airline pilot. ""Uhhhhhhhh, this is your captain speaking...."" The only adjustments to the VOX sensitivity is ""HI"" or ""LO,"" so fine tuning may be necessary to talk louder or softer, or adjust the microphone placement away or closer to the mouth. I wish it had infinite sensitivity adjustment using a dial.

Being able to use the full list of 22 FRS frequencies is nice, unlike cheap walkie talkies that only offer 10 or so. The priority channel feature nice and could come in handy at a large event when users on different frequencies: this is basically a scam feature. The audio quality is OK, but this is a $50 toy radio, I guess.

The 99 sub channels are not really sub channels, but by using CTCSS, transmission from radios not using the same CTCSS is not heard on the handset. Wikipedia has a good explanation:
""CTCSS tone codes are sometimes referred to as sub-channels, but this is a misnomer because no additional radio channels are created. All users with different CTCSS tones on the same channel are still transmitting on the identical radio frequency, and their transmissions interfere with each other; however; the interference is masked under most conditions. Although it provides some protection against interference, CTCSS does not offer any security against interception or jamming, and receivers without CTCSS enabled will still hear all traffic.""

Being an FRS radio, if you use this in a busy area, you may unfortunately have to hunt for an open frequency.

My only concern with the WT attachment is wether the WT attachment would stay properly mated to the RSEM during movements. I can pull on the bottom of the WT attachment and partially unplug it moderately easily even with the top clamp on. It may be that the plastic moulding of the RSEM or WT attachment is inconsistent, and some reshaping or modification is needed. I'll continue to monitor, and see if I can identify an easy solution.

Overall, this is a great solution for on the shooting range.",4,B076HG138S,"This review two related items: ~ Walker's Razor Slim Electronic Muff (RSEM) light teal color (ASIN: B076HG138S; item model number: GWP-RSEM-LTL; price 2025/05/23: $32.79; price 2025/05/30: $46.46) ~ Walker's Walkie Talkie (WT) attachment (ASIN: B07QFCP93T; item model number: GWP-RZRWT; price 2015/05/23: $26.20; price today: $28.99 $49.99) I've used Howard Leight Impact Sport (HLIS) electronic earmuffs years, portion review comparison HL.

1500,1610,1610,A valuable addition to the bookshelf: worth the time and the money,"Platt's 'Enc. of Electronic Components' is a good read, lots of information on the components covered, and strikes a fine balance between underwhelming the knowledgeable and overwhelming those who 'just don't know.'

I wanted to know more about capacitors. Now I have read why I might choose polyethylene over mylar, or tantalum caps over electrolytics. I wanted to know more about coils, inductors, and now there is a little more knowledge to fill the wells of memory there as well.

Lots of good information on resistors, capacitors (including the actual schematics for RC high and low pass filters), a little later there are LCR filters, diodes, a variety of diodes and transistor types. There is a very good section on a variety of motors - better here than I expected, so I learned more where I hadn't thought I would.

Platt introduces the volume by suggesting the book will gather enough information to be usable, in one place, effectively 'peer reviewed' for accuracy and legitimacy, and the book certainly lives up to that aim.

In all chapters on components there is a 'what could go wrong' section; that is what I'm going to add here. My two big complaints have to do with typeface/font selection and the layout of illustrations. The font used for formulae I find hard to read quickly and accurately. Most troublesome is the 'pi' symbol which quite often I mistake for an 'n' which I catch because I know the equation - but I can see being caught out. That I would like to see changed. The other complaint is the number of times throughout the book where the text refers to an illustration -- which is on the next page. It sounds like a minor complaint but can be irritating.

Those two quibbles aside I'm glad I bought the book. If my bookshelf had a fire, earthquake, tsunami, or house-cleaner come through I would buy another copy quickly.

And, once through the first couple chapters, I want to know when the next (two!) volumes are coming out?

1503,1613,1613,Too much detail on simple things not enough on hard things,"This book is great as an introduction into Electronics. I think it's useful to have around in case you ever want to look anything up but I was under the assumption it would be more encyclopedic whereas this is sort of like a 6th graders reference book for not any sort of actual practical referencing but just something need to look at in read. There are some chapters that are incredibly long on things like relays that, while correct and useful to people who use a lot of relays, are incredibly boring for 90% of the people that are going to be reading this book. Relay is a great device if you're making an oven but if you're making an oven you're not reading this book. That is to say, the writer is very intelligent as far as electrical engineering goes however the writer is not cognizant of who he is writing to, he switches between thinking his audiences incredibly developed in their Electronics knowledge and thinking that his audience knows nothing about Electronics. For example, the DC motor and AC motor section is the majority of the book. I mean not exactly but it's very long however a DC motor has two connectors and we all know how to wire it up to get it to work it's the simplest electronic component in the world. The mosfet is given 2 pages and is lumped in with the JFET, and enhancement mode, depletion mode, and channel, P Channel, the various regions, and it's applications (of which the P Channel mosfet application listed was something like ""no one uses p channel mosfets"") are zoomed through. The incongruity there being that the mosfet is very likely the most used electronic component in history and the relay is giving much more detail.

however I got this book when I didn't know s*** about electronics and now I do so maybe I can sound all high-and-mighty like this because I read the book and having read the book I Now understand Electronics. It's a chicken or the egg kind of thing. But this is a genuine review and if this is what you want, and I'm sure it is, then you should buy the book because I did and now I know electronics well enough to write a review ragging on this book (chicken/egg

However, in February 2024 one of them just stopped working.  It looks as though it is charged up when plugged in to charge, but as soon as I attempt to use any of the charging ports or magnetic charger or cables it just flashes “188” for a few seconds and shuts off.

I was willing to just assume it was dud, and continued to use the second one, but as of today (May 2024) the second one is now doing the same thing and it won’t charge any devices at all.  It just flashes the “188” for a few seconds and then turns off.

I really want these to be reliable.  I love their multiple ports and charging features, and up until they both just died, they were awesome.

1543,1656,1656,Portable wireless charger for IPhones,"This charger performs exactly as advertised. Some reviews complain about charging time. My impression is that it holds enough battery power for several recharges or to charge several devices simultaneously. I imagine that would take some time to replace. Other reviews say it takes a tool to get the charging cables out of their compartments, but I found it easy to do with a thumbnail. (See video) The magnetic hold is not powerful enough to hold through my case but it will charge if centered properly. When I remove the case the magnetic grip is excellent, holding the charger in place and serving as a phone stand, a grip, whatever. If this charger doesn’t continue to perform well I will revise the review but I don’t see that happening.
Edit: I have bought three of these chargers. The first took days to fully charge, because I kept unplugging it and using it. I used the larger charge port to do this. The second was for my wife who immediately wanted one of her own. I charged it overnight with the smaller, iPhone style port. Then I dropped the first one and the case came loose. It still works fine but I wanted a backup in case it broke down. I charged it with the iPhone charger port too and it was fully charged in an hour.

But wait, there's a small, annoying LED light from your electronic device flickering persistently. Sounds familiar, right? Well, I stumbled upon a simple yet brilliant solution - stickers!

I'll be honest, initially, I was skeptical. How could something as straightforward as a sticker solve my light pollution woes? But, to my surprise, these stickers are a game-changer. They come in two sheets, offering a variety of sizes and shapes (circle and rectangular) to fit different devices. The package contains both black and white stickers, catering to different surface colors of our various light-emitting devices.

What impressed me the most was their effectiveness. These stickers block 100% of LED lights, and the adhesive strength is remarkable. They stick firmly without leaving any residue when removed. Plus, they are incredibly easy to use – just peel and stick. I’ve used them on my router, printer, and even my laptop charger, and the results are flawless. No more unwanted LED glare!

Another aspect worth mentioning is their versatility. The stickers are not just for nighttime. I found them useful for dimming lights on devices I use during the day, creating a more comfortable and distraction-free environment.

The pack includes two sheets, and the price is a small investment for the comfort and convenience they offer. These stickers have become an essential in my household, and I've even recommended them to friends and family.

The plastic feels more expensive and the metallic features are nice. However the magnet was not as strong as I would have liked. My phone tended to slump down on it.

The extendable arm cantilevers the mount in a way that makes it VERY stable, even for a large phone. But possibly even better than that is the pivoting head of the mount, which allows me to tilt the phone slightly if the sun is too bright overhead to see the map while I'm navigating.

The only downside I could see to a more simply designed vent mount: because of the cantilever arm, this mount isn't quite as quick as others to install and remove IF you need to switch it between cars a lot (which I don't).

The magnets are crazy strong, and each mount comes with a bigger square magnet, and 2 smaller circles. I mounted the bigger magnet to my phone, and you can barely tell. It’s no more than half the thickness of a credit card, and doesn’t leave a bump under the case, and still strong enough to cling on to my phone securely. That thing isn’t going anywhere. My girlfriend has a “wallet- phone case”, which is pretty heavy and unwieldy in my opinion, but she stuck the magnet to the inside of the outermost slot, and to my surprise, the magnet holds, no problem! Definitely recommend. It takes a little patience and a gentle touch to mount the holder, but so worth it, and super secure once you get it in.

1605,1722,1722,Great solution,"This is a review of two related items:
~ Walker's Razor Slim Electronic Muff (RSEM) light teal color (ASIN: B076HG138S; item model number: GWP-RSEM-LTL; price on 2025/05/23: $32.79; price 2025/05/30: $46.46)
~ Walker's Walkie Talkie (WT) attachment (ASIN: B07QFCP93T; item model number: GWP-RZRWT; price on 2015/05/23: $26.20; price today: $28.99 down from $49.99)

I've used the Howard Leight Impact Sport (HLIS) electronic earmuffs for years, so some portion of this review will be in comparison to the HL.

The Walker's RSEM is very similar to HLIS in design and in function. The headband, the muffs, and the general construction is very similar as if they copied each other's design.

The RSEM (just like the HLIS) has a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of low to mid 20s. For hearing protection while shooting, I don't consider 20 dB of reduction to be adequate, and I usually wear NRR 30 disposable foam earplugs under the muffs. Because the amplified electronic earmuff volume can be turned up, NRR 30 earplugs would be fine to wear underneath. In a traditional non-electronic earmuff, wearing foam ear plugs underneath maybe too much attenuation if you want to have a conversation with someone.

The RSEM (just like the HLIS) has a slim design. Collapsed, they are moderately compact, and do not take up a lot of space in the shooting bag.

The RSEM (just like the HLIS) has an auxiliary headphone jack, so you can plug in an audio plug to listen to music, or use this jack to plug in a two way radio attachment. Walker's makes the WT attachment which is affordable and easy to use. Meanwhile, I'm not able to easily find a simple solution for the lay shooter using the HLIS.

There is no active noise cancellation, however, I've could say this offers active noise reduction with passive nose isolation; noise isolation from the ear muffs, and nose reduction from the microcircuit that selectively amplifies ambient noise except for loud noises.

The RSEM comes in many colors and designs, and while they retail for $79.99 on Amazon, some can be found on sale for around $32. It's hard to find them all and compare priceson Amazon because they're not all on the same Amazon page. Currently, it looks like the Razor Tacti-Grip Slim Electronic muff (ASIN: B08LXS9B9M; item model number: GWP-RSEMRH) is the least expensive at $34.45.

The Howard Leight does offer some color and design options, but far fewer than Walker's does. These retail for $90 to $110 on Amazon, and some can be found as low as $60.

The RSEM (just like the HLIS) is not that comfortable to wear, but it's tolerable for a few hours. They can be worn over a baseball cap. They won't fit very well over a normal thickness beanie.

Now, onto the Walker's WT attachment. This is thing that sets the RSEM apart from the HLIS. This attachment is affordable, easy to install, easy to use, and requires no other equipment. (In contrast, I did come across two way radio adapters that turn a handheld radio and the HLIS into a communication device, but that's not quite affordable or easy to use.)

After I installed three AAA batteries into the WT attachment, I attached it to the RSEM. The instructions didn't mention removing the rubber cap to the headphone jack, but I felt this was necessary for a good fit. I was initially unable to hear any received transmission. After a few moments, I found that this was because the WT attachment didn't fit onto the muff very well, and the plug wasn't fully seated into the jack. With some force, I was able to mate the WT attachment to the RSEM, and was able to hear received transmission.

The mic seems a little short, but it picks up well even with VOX. Three is a little bit of delay from the time I start speaking until VOX turns l activates, but the solution is to talk like an airline pilot. ""Uhhhhhhhh, this is your captain speaking...."" The only adjustments to the VOX sensitivity is ""HI"" or ""LO,"" so fine tuning may be necessary to talk louder or softer, or adjust the microphone placement away or closer to the mouth. I wish it had infinite sensitivity adjustment using a dial.

Being able to use the full list of 22 FRS frequencies is nice, unlike cheap walkie talkies that only offer 10 or so. The priority channel feature nice and could come in handy at a large event when users on different frequencies: this is basically a scam feature. The audio quality is OK, but this is a $50 toy radio, I guess.

The 99 sub channels are not really sub channels, but by using CTCSS, transmission from radios not using the same CTCSS is not heard on the handset. Wikipedia has a good explanation:
""CTCSS tone codes are sometimes referred to as sub-channels, but this is a misnomer because no additional radio channels are created. All users with different CTCSS tones on the same channel are still transmitting on the identical radio frequency, and their transmissions interfere with each other; however; the interference is masked under most conditions. Although it provides some protection against interference, CTCSS does not offer any security against interception or jamming, and receivers without CTCSS enabled will still hear all traffic.""

Being an FRS radio, if you use this in a busy area, you may unfortunately have to hunt for an open frequency.

My only concern with the WT attachment is wether the WT attachment would stay properly mated to the RSEM during movements. I can pull on the bottom of the WT attachment and partially unplug it moderately easily even with the top clamp on. It may be that the plastic moulding of the RSEM or WT attachment is inconsistent, and some reshaping or modification is needed. I'll continue to monitor, and see if I can identify an easy solution.

Overall, this is a great solution for on the shooting range.",4,B076HG138S,"This review two related items: ~ Walker's Razor Slim Electronic Muff (RSEM) light teal color (ASIN: B076HG138S; item model number: GWP-RSEM-LTL; price 2025/05/23: $32.79; price 2025/05/30: $46.46) ~ Walker's Walkie Talkie (WT) attachment (ASIN: B07QFCP93T; item model number: GWP-RZRWT; price 2015/05/23: $26.20; price today: $28.99 $49.99) I've used Howard Leight Impact Sport (HLIS) electronic earmuffs years, portion review comparison HL.

1611,1729,1729,Unstuck Rear Heated Seat Control Switch Button on SUV,"Okay. So I had a push button control for one of the rear heated captain's chairs in my Hyundai Palisade that was ""sticking"" in the down position.

This push button should pop back up after each time it is pressed, cycling between High, Medium, Low, and Off settings with successive button presses.

So I found a video online where a similar problem was fixed with a little spritz of electronic contact cleaner. My vehicle is under warranty, but when I considered the time and fuel I would expend taking this to the dealer (45 minutes driving one way from my home up on the mountain), I realized that purchasing this contact cleaner might actually save me money. I assumed the techician at the dealer would probably fix this by using contact cleaner like this anyway. So I rolled the dice.

A tiny spritz of this CRC contact cleaner and a couple button presses completely solved the ""sticking"" of this switch. The switch button, surround, and nearby display are all plastic; Some of these plastics are black, others are clear, and some have decals or painted labels. The entire rear passenger control panel is surrounded by cream colored leather. None of these surfaces were discolored, harmed, or changed by this contact cleaner. The product description says this contact cleaner is safe on plastic and this is absolutely true.

I have also used this product to clean out exploded alkaline battery gunk from inside a laser level and a grilling meat thermometer, both of which were no longer working. I was able to restore both of these devices to full function with a thorough cleaning with this CRC contact cleaner. Both items were plastic and again, the appearance of my laser level and my thermometer were not changed one bit (other than both look completely fresh and clean now).

If you do not have an Arduino compatible board already, don't forget to pick up a Keyestudio one. I highly recommend the Keyestudio Plus board because of the additional features as well as a USB-C connection. I have a few Arduino boards, other knockoff Arduino boards and a few models of the Keyestudio ones. For the majority of projects, the Plus board is perfect.

If you are new to the Arduino system, this kit is perfect because it gives you 37 different modules to play around with. Even if you already have Arduino stuff and are just looking to expand your collection, this is a very cost-effective way to get a variety of modules.

Keyestudio also provides a WIKI on their website with step-by-step instructions on how to configure and use each of the modules. Along with the WIKI, they have a PDF that you can download instead or even videos related to each module.

The support they provide is fantastic. They are in China, so it can take a day or so to receive a response, but you will get an answer to any of your questions from a real person. As for being in China, the instructions do have a few minor translation errors, but everything is still very understandable and they are constantly working to update and correct any errors that may exist. If you find something not quite right, let them know and they will get it fixed.

Keyestudio has so many different products available that you do not have to spend the extra money and buy name brand. There are a few items they don't produce, but they have something for just about every case you can imagine. If they don't, let them know. They greatly appreciate feedback regarding anything to do with their products and support.

The more Keyestudio products I purchase, the more happy I am with them. I have been using their products for a number of years now.

1653,1772,1772,Great solution,"This is a review of two related items:
~ Walker's Razor Slim Electronic Muff (RSEM) light teal color (ASIN: B076HG138S; item model number: GWP-RSEM-LTL; price on 2025/05/23: $32.79; price 2025/05/30: $46.46)
~ Walker's Walkie Talkie (WT) attachment (ASIN: B07QFCP93T; item model number: GWP-RZRWT; price on 2015/05/23: $26.20; price today: $28.99 down from $49.99)

I've used the Howard Leight Impact Sport (HLIS) electronic earmuffs for years, so some portion of this review will be in comparison to the HL.

The Walker's RSEM is very similar to HLIS in design and in function. The headband, the muffs, and the general construction is very similar as if they copied each other's design.

The RSEM (just like the HLIS) has a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of low to mid 20s. For hearing protection while shooting, I don't consider 20 dB of reduction to be adequate, and I usually wear NRR 30 disposable foam earplugs under the muffs. Because the amplified electronic earmuff volume can be turned up, NRR 30 earplugs would be fine to wear underneath. In a traditional non-electronic earmuff, wearing foam ear plugs underneath maybe too much attenuation if you want to have a conversation with someone.

The RSEM (just like the HLIS) has a slim design. Collapsed, they are moderately compact, and do not take up a lot of space in the shooting bag.

The RSEM (just like the HLIS) has an auxiliary headphone jack, so you can plug in an audio plug to listen to music, or use this jack to plug in a two way radio attachment. Walker's makes the WT attachment which is affordable and easy to use. Meanwhile, I'm not able to easily find a simple solution for the lay shooter using the HLIS.

There is no active noise cancellation, however, I've could say this offers active noise reduction with passive nose isolation; noise isolation from the ear muffs, and nose reduction from the microcircuit that selectively amplifies ambient noise except for loud noises.

The RSEM comes in many colors and designs, and while they retail for $79.99 on Amazon, some can be found on sale for around $32. It's hard to find them all and compare priceson Amazon because they're not all on the same Amazon page. Currently, it looks like the Razor Tacti-Grip Slim Electronic muff (ASIN: B08LXS9B9M; item model number: GWP-RSEMRH) is the least expensive at $34.45.

The Howard Leight does offer some color and design options, but far fewer than Walker's does. These retail for $90 to $110 on Amazon, and some can be found as low as $60.

The RSEM (just like the HLIS) is not that comfortable to wear, but it's tolerable for a few hours. They can be worn over a baseball cap. They won't fit very well over a normal thickness beanie.

Now, onto the Walker's WT attachment. This is thing that sets the RSEM apart from the HLIS. This attachment is affordable, easy to install, easy to use, and requires no other equipment. (In contrast, I did come across two way radio adapters that turn a handheld radio and the HLIS into a communication device, but that's not quite affordable or easy to use.)

After I installed three AAA batteries into the WT attachment, I attached it to the RSEM. The instructions didn't mention removing the rubber cap to the headphone jack, but I felt this was necessary for a good fit. I was initially unable to hear any received transmission. After a few moments, I found that this was because the WT attachment didn't fit onto the muff very well, and the plug wasn't fully seated into the jack. With some force, I was able to mate the WT attachment to the RSEM, and was able to hear received transmission.

The mic seems a little short, but it picks up well even with VOX. Three is a little bit of delay from the time I start speaking until VOX turns l activates, but the solution is to talk like an airline pilot. ""Uhhhhhhhh, this is your captain speaking...."" The only adjustments to the VOX sensitivity is ""HI"" or ""LO,"" so fine tuning may be necessary to talk louder or softer, or adjust the microphone placement away or closer to the mouth. I wish it had infinite sensitivity adjustment using a dial.

Being able to use the full list of 22 FRS frequencies is nice, unlike cheap walkie talkies that only offer 10 or so. The priority channel feature nice and could come in handy at a large event when users on different frequencies: this is basically a scam feature. The audio quality is OK, but this is a $50 toy radio, I guess.

The 99 sub channels are not really sub channels, but by using CTCSS, transmission from radios not using the same CTCSS is not heard on the handset. Wikipedia has a good explanation:
""CTCSS tone codes are sometimes referred to as sub-channels, but this is a misnomer because no additional radio channels are created. All users with different CTCSS tones on the same channel are still transmitting on the identical radio frequency, and their transmissions interfere with each other; however; the interference is masked under most conditions. Although it provides some protection against interference, CTCSS does not offer any security against interception or jamming, and receivers without CTCSS enabled will still hear all traffic.""

Being an FRS radio, if you use this in a busy area, you may unfortunately have to hunt for an open frequency.

My only concern with the WT attachment is wether the WT attachment would stay properly mated to the RSEM during movements. I can pull on the bottom of the WT attachment and partially unplug it moderately easily even with the top clamp on. It may be that the plastic moulding of the RSEM or WT attachment is inconsistent, and some reshaping or modification is needed. I'll continue to monitor, and see if I can identify an easy solution.

Overall, this is a great solution for on the shooting range.",4,B076HG138S,"This review two related items: ~ Walker's Razor Slim Electronic Muff (RSEM) light teal color (ASIN: B076HG138S; item model number: GWP-RSEM-LTL; price 2025/05/23: $32.79; price 2025/05/30: $46.46) ~ Walker's Walkie Talkie (WT) attachment (ASIN: B07QFCP93T; item model number: GWP-RZRWT; price 2015/05/23: $26.20; price today: $28.99 $49.99) I've used Howard Leight Impact Sport (HLIS) electronic earmuffs years, portion review comparison HL.

1659,1779,1779,Unstuck Rear Heated Seat Control Switch Button on SUV,"Okay. So I had a push button control for one of the rear heated captain's chairs in my Hyundai Palisade that was ""sticking"" in the down position.

This push button should pop back up after each time it is pressed, cycling between High, Medium, Low, and Off settings with successive button presses.

So I found a video online where a similar problem was fixed with a little spritz of electronic contact cleaner.

What I liked about it was the ease of locating your claim by selecting the amazon button to begin the claim process on the Asurion website and that it pulled up all the items I had under warranty through that vendor. I like that I was credited the full amount via digital gift card that I could post on Amazon right away from the code that was sent to my email. What I didn't like was that when purchasing an item the gift card section in checkout will not show you the full available amount of gift card balance if the purchase is less than the available amount. If you have a 70.00 gift card credit and you are buying a 15.00 item it will only show you 15.00 available gift card amount in checkout. To know the real amount available you have to select Account and Lists at the top right of the page then select Accounts, then select Gift cards to see the original amount credited and what remains. Every time you make a purchase you will see a deduction listed in gif cards section until the credit balance is used to 0 balance.

I was lucky and found the same item for less and was able to repurchase it with  another 3 year warranty but what does a customer do when the item is hard to find, or has increased in value due to market demand. When an item increases in value such as when graphics card prices doubled and tripled due to shortages, it takes the responsibility of replacement off the vendor and places the burden on the consumer.

1750,1886,1886,Claim was paid... after jumping through a couple of hoops,"I actually forgot that I had purchased this plan with my Fitbit, so when the device died of an overheated battery while charging exactly 3 weeks after it was out of the manufacturer warranty, I complained directly to Fitbit. I knew they had a history of battery problems and had extended warranty periods in the past because of it. After a week of runaround, they decided that it was out of warranty, but that they would give me a discount if I bought a new device directly from their store. Months later I realized I had purchased this 3-year plan from Amazon with the original Fitbit, so I decided to turn in the claim on the fried device.

I went to the website stipulated, logged in, saw the plan for the device, and tried to place the claim. The site just froze up and ""spun"" for like 10 minutes before I tried closing it out and starting over. When I went back to the site to start the process again, the plan/device I needed to claim was no longer showing up in the account. I went through a bunch of windows before it finally gave me a phone number to call.

I called that number, went through several automated prompts telling me to use the website, and finally got to a human Representative. Then I was told I had called the wrong number since I bought my device and plan through Amazon, and that they would transfer me. Got transferred to a number that thought I was calling from the other 800-number, so it couldn't find my account. Finally got to another human Representative, who eventually could see the plan that was no longer visible to me on my account. I told her what happened with the fried Fitbit, she placed the claim, and emailed me a mailing label to send the dead device to them. It took me a few days to find a box to ship it in and print out the label, but once they had notification that UPS had picked up the package, I was emailed an Amazon gift card claim code for the purchase price of my device. I didn't even have to wait for them to receive the package.

The cable did not introduce any hum or noise to the signal and it did not affect the tone of the signal like some others in this price range have

While I wouldn't gig with this cable I WOULD take it with me to a gig as a backup. 10 feet is not very long but it would go between my pedal board and amp in small venues if I needed it.

1783,1922,1922,Not a full replacement for disposable air cans,"First impression:
This powered air duster has a good heft, fits well in hand, and when turned on is noisy, but not overwhelmingly noisy. I thought to use as a replacement for commodity air cans that spray a thin, but fast, jet to dislodge dust, hair and other particles from keyboards and sundry small items. It appears this duster works also as an inflator for  beach-balls and similar items. The complement of accessory is fluent--perhaps even overabundant.

Use:
To me, the value of air cans rests in the ability to produce a jet sufficient to clean up my items with parts too tiny or complex to reach otherwise. Accordingly, I used a Davis Instrument Wind Wizard pocket anemometer to compare the speed of the air flow. The thin jet of an air can tossed the dial of the anemometer to maybe 50 miles per hour. The sharpest blast from this air duster made it to, uh, 35 miles per hour. Mine is not a rigorous test, rather, it's just a ballpark for comparison.  Whereas the air can jet is extremely thin, the air duster is thicker and provides much more volume, if not as fast. Effectiveness-wise, the air duster offers a less powerful, but more abundant flow. When compared to an air can, this electric duster is better at some tasks, not as good for others.

Conclusion:
Mixed results. I will use my air can less frequently, but I suspect I will still need it.  If you need a beach-ball or life-saver inflator, this may be your item, but I've not tested it for that purpose.",4,B0CNSM1SPJ,"First impression: This powered air duster good heft, fits well hand, turned noisy, overwhelmingly noisy.

1785,1924,1924,"Convenient, money saving, time saving, good battery, and","Currently, I'm using this mostly for work and just about daily. This isn't the first kind of blower tool that I have used or own.

After unboxing and charging, I found it relatively simple to use and to keep charged.  The battery seems to be pretty good and lasts a while. I end up using this over the period of a few days for a few minutes each day without having to charge it.

The directions were pretty simple and clear. All of the attachments are pretty straightforward on what they are used for. It also comes with a few useful brushes that I have been tending to use more frequently. It came with a bag but was a little small to quickly grab and pull out what I needed, so I replaced it with a wider zip-up style pouch.

The shell material seems to be nice and solid. I’ve dropped it more than once, from about my torso level,  and it has only accumulated a few scuffs. I’ve had it turn on (once) while it was in one of my work bags, but that was after I threw all my other tools on top of it. I appreciate the bright color accents on some of these tools since it makes it easier to see in low-light conditions, which happens every once in a while.

There are three different settings for speed, which have all come in handy for cleaning things from delicate equipment and all the way to blowing food debris out of keyboards. This has been especially useful when cleaning quite a few digital projector filters and working through different laptops/Chromebooks, cases, and keyboards.

It’s a great product, makes my day to day a lot easier, and saves me a little bit of money every month. I still use compressed air here and there, but only for certain things that need a bit more focused air. So, it saves me a bit of money on re-supply. I've also created a nozzle out of heat-shrink tubing for doing certain things that require a more focused stream of air similar to canned.

These wouldn’t seem like they’d make that big of a difference with convenience, but they do, especially when having to use canned air over any length of time. It's a nice little tool that saves me time, money, and sometimes patience. It hasn't 100% replaced my cans just yet, though.",5,B0CNSM1SPJ,"Currently, I'm using mostly work daily.

I noticed that the smaller the attachment end that you used was the warmer the air was coming out of the unit and the motor sounds like it was working harder with anything but the largest attachment.  I measured a +35F temperature rise from intake to output on the smaller nozzle (the inflator).  I would hesitate to trust this to inflate large items like a bed long term but it could do that purpose in a pinch.  The beauty of this unit is just to blow some air on things (had an old monitor that had dust all over it that I took outside to blast).

1791,1930,1930,Much better than canned air but not a million rpm,"I recently acquired the Rechargeable Cordless Air Duster, and despite some variations from its advertised specifications, it's proven to be an incredibly useful addition to my cleaning arsenal.

Let's start with its positives: this air duster comes with a variety of brushes and nozzles, making it a versatile tool for cleaning different surfaces and hard-to-reach areas. The inclusion of a bag for easy storage and transportation is a thoughtful addition, keeping all the attachments organized and accessible.

One of the claims made about this duster is its purported 1,000,000 RPM spinning power. However, upon testing, it operates closer to 3,000 RPM. While this discrepancy might disappoint some, I found that the actual power output, though not as advertised, still surpasses traditional canned air. It effectively blows away dust and debris, providing a more robust cleaning experience.

In terms of its power, it's fair to say that it resembles the force of a hairdryer when used with a concentrated nozzle. While not hitting the high-speed claims, the concentrated airflow manages to dislodge dust and particles better than the typical canned air products I've used in the past. It's quieter and doesn't produce the chilly blast that canned air often does, which I consider a plus.

The rechargeable feature is a game-changer. No more worrying about constantly buying replacement cans or dealing with a cord while cleaning. The battery life is decent and lasts through several cleaning sessions before needing a recharge, making it convenient for regular use.

Although it might not meet the lofty RPM claims, the Rechargeable Cordless Air Duster excels in practicality. Its increased power compared to canned air and the array of attachments make it a reliable tool for various cleaning tasks around the house or office.",4,B0CNSM1SPJ,"I recently acquired Rechargeable Cordless Air Duster, despite variations advertised specifications, proven incredibly useful addition cleaning arsenal.

1817,1961,1961,Solid vent holder with a minor caveat,"First a little background. I bought this to replace a window mounted suction holder, as I found out that having one of those could have lead to a distracted driving ticket. I saw the positive reviews on this, and gave it a shot. So I'm going to go through the different aspects of this mount and some of the pros and cons.

Build:
Honestly, aside from the cheap ones you'd find in a Dollar+ store, I have found the build quality of all these mounts are pretty similar. The plastic is solid and doesn't feel flimsy at all. The padding is actually the star, as the foam while not thick seems perfect for protecting your phone if you don't have a case. And the mounting clip seems very well built.

Mounting:
They have a switch that allows  for tighter and looser fitting depending on your vent. This product only works on vertical and horizontal vents, and I suspect that it would work better on horizontal vents. Once I put it on the top blade of my drivers side center console vent, I was set. It is very stable and very well positioned. In my Subaru, the only thing it blocks when my phone is mounted is the time. Without my phone nothing is blocked, aside from the vent.

Phone holder and release:
So this is where it gets interesting. Many other products on the market have a quick snap closed and open using springs. This uses a click lock which is manually engaged by the user. I actually prefer this, though it isn't as quick it is far more secure. The release however is not as quick as I expected. However it isn't particularly slow either. Perhaps it is because I'm used to the all in style of other mounts where it snaps to full open or full close around your phone, this is more gradual. However because of the design you perhaps don't want to have it open quicker because that would mean having to close it a further distance because of the click step locking mechanism they are employing.

Directional maneuverability:
This is as described. It is sufficiently 360 degrees, and I'm sure I could rotate it 90 degrees to have my phone horizontal if I should so desire, though I feel like the vent mounted work better as a vertical, while window mounted work better horizontal. There is a limit to how far down tilt I can go because of the vent and center console getting in the way, but that would also impede my ability to use the phone for directions anyway, so it is a moot point.

Pros:
- Far easier to access phone. Window mounted tend to be positioned a bit further away.
- Not in direct sun. With window mounted, I was often unable to charge my phone because the sun made the battery too hot to actually charge it. Having it out of the sun is a big positive
-More secure than spring activated button type mounts.
- Having your AC on can potentially cool off an overheating phone

Cons:
-The main con is that the bottom cradle where the phone sits is immovable. For many modern phones and car entertainment systems this is a nonissue, however if you have a phone with a headphone jack next to the charging port and a car that needs an aux port to get music, this design effectively prevents you from using it. The only recourse would be to have it horizontal with the charging port and headphone jack facing the top, which some might find inconvenient.
- It blocks a vent. Though as stated in pros, this can be a positive. However in winter months, you'd probably have to shut a vent down to prevent your phone from overheating from heat coming from the vent. So if your car is unable to turn a vent off, this might be a bigger issue.
- The motion lock system seems a bit weak compared to other mounts. I haven't had any issues from it, but it is worth noting. Basically even when tightened all the way I can still move it, but not without a bit of effort. This is double edged, as I can still move it without loosing it, which is good, but it can potentially move without input over time should it ever loosen even the slightest.

Overall this is a great car vent mount. The minor issues I have with it are really non-issues for me, as I have a Bluetooth system, and most cars today are either Bluetooth or use USB to connect for audio. If you don't you might want to consider that before buying. However if you use a dongle at the USB/Lightning port, it should be fine. I'd fully recommend this product. It is a solid mount and I don't see many points of failure at this time.

1830,1976,1976,Quick process and fast credit,"I used this for a pair of Plantronics Backbeat 410 Bluetooth head set. What I liked about it was the ease of locating your claim by selecting the amazon button to begin the claim process on the Asurion website and that it pulled up all the items I had under warranty through that vendor. I like that I was credited the full amount via digital gift card that I could post on Amazon right away from the code that was sent to my email. What I didn't like was that when purchasing an item the gift card section in checkout will not show you the full available amount of gift card balance if the purchase is less than the available amount. If you have a 70.00 gift card credit and you are buying a 15.00 item it will only show you 15.00 available gift card amount in checkout. To know the real amount available you have to select Account and Lists at the top right of the page then select Accounts, then select Gift cards to see the original amount credited and what remains. Every time you make a purchase you will see a deduction listed in gif cards section until the credit balance is used to 0 balance. Its a couple of extra steps that some consumers will have trouble figuring out thus causing confusion and unnecessary calls or emails to customer service. I am posting this to help others not go through the trouble I went though after a chat with Asurion website and a search on the Amazon Website.

I like that I was credited the full amount via digital gift card that I could post on Amazon right away from the code that was sent to my email. What I didn't like was that when purchasing an item the gift card section in checkout will not show you the full available amount of gift card balance if the purchase is less than the available amount. If you have a 70.00 gift card credit and you are buying a 15.00 item it will only show you 15.00 available gift card amount in checkout.

Installation is already easy and made easier with the built-in level. Simply hold level and screw/drill in screws. But honestly, one of the best things about this mount are the included screws. Their thick threading ensures that the mount being ripped off or loosened is almost impossible.

As for the quality of the mount holding my PS3 Slim, which isn't exactly light (7 lbs), no complaints. It was pain to set up within the straps as I needed a second set of hands, but it is very secure and I trust it's not going anywhere. But as a tip for anyone installing heavier objects, make sure the adjuster buckles are near the top. Because of the PS3's weight, it unavoidably weighed the straps down so I found that tightening the console near the top secures it in places without gravity playing too much of a role.

The straps that are included are large enough to fit around an entire PC case, so using it on my little router is overkill. However, I don't want to cut them as I am going to upgrade my router.

It is very straight forward and easy to install. The plastic buckle on the provided straps are less than impressive as they do not tighten as much as I would like. That having said that I'm not in fear of it falling because each is secure and snug against the console.

If your item is larger than the mount than it will be able to move length-wise as the straps are not connected to the mount but rather you push them through the provided slots. On my next install, I'm going to try using a wedge or clamp that will keep the straps secured to the mount to mitigate this.

The install hardware consist of 6 bear-claw style drywall screws. These are have very poor quality control as 2 of the screws had 1/4in metal shavings attached to them one of which sliced open my finger during install. I was using a simple screwdriver and was being moderately careful as to not damage the plastic. I recommend using anchors that you are more familiar with. Also I will be using washers next time as the holes in the plastic have a small lip in them that the screw is supposed to snug up to and I don't feel as comfortable with it after actually mounting the console. I did a fair amount of tugging on the straps to try and tighten them and was worried I may pull the mount loose.

Over all, I very much like this item. It is very versatile and you cannot beat the price. i will defiantly be buying this again and using my own hardware to mount so that I feel more secure putting expensive items 6 ft off the ground.

1867,2021,2021,Solid vent holder with a minor caveat,"First a little background. I bought this to replace a window mounted suction holder, as I found out that having one of those could have lead to a distracted driving ticket. I saw the positive reviews on this, and gave it a shot. So I'm going to go through the different aspects of this mount and some of the pros and cons.

Build:
Honestly, aside from the cheap ones you'd find in a Dollar+ store, I have found the build quality of all these mounts are pretty similar. The plastic is solid and doesn't feel flimsy at all. The padding is actually the star, as the foam while not thick seems perfect for protecting your phone if you don't have a case. And the mounting clip seems very well built.

Mounting:
They have a switch that allows  for tighter and looser fitting depending on your vent. This product only works on vertical and horizontal vents, and I suspect that it would work better on horizontal vents. Once I put it on the top blade of my drivers side center console vent, I was set. It is very stable and very well positioned. In my Subaru, the only thing it blocks when my phone is mounted is the time. Without my phone nothing is blocked, aside from the vent.

Phone holder and release:
So this is where it gets interesting. Many other products on the market have a quick snap closed and open using springs. This uses a click lock which is manually engaged by the user. I actually prefer this, though it isn't as quick it is far more secure. The release however is not as quick as I expected. However it isn't particularly slow either. Perhaps it is because I'm used to the all in style of other mounts where it snaps to full open or full close around your phone, this is more gradual. However because of the design you perhaps don't want to have it open quicker because that would mean having to close it a further distance because of the click step locking mechanism they are employing.

Directional maneuverability:
This is as described. It is sufficiently 360 degrees, and I'm sure I could rotate it 90 degrees to have my phone horizontal if I should so desire, though I feel like the vent mounted work better as a vertical, while window mounted work better horizontal. There is a limit to how far down tilt I can go because of the vent and center console getting in the way, but that would also impede my ability to use the phone for directions anyway, so it is a moot point.

Pros:
- Far easier to access phone. Window mounted tend to be positioned a bit further away.
- Not in direct sun. With window mounted, I was often unable to charge my phone because the sun made the battery too hot to actually charge it. Having it out of the sun is a big positive
-More secure than spring activated button type mounts.
- Having your AC on can potentially cool off an overheating phone

Cons:
-The main con is that the bottom cradle where the phone sits is immovable. For many modern phones and car entertainment systems this is a nonissue, however if you have a phone with a headphone jack next to the charging port and a car that needs an aux port to get music, this design effectively prevents you from using it. The only recourse would be to have it horizontal with the charging port and headphone jack facing the top, which some might find inconvenient.
- It blocks a vent. Though as stated in pros, this can be a positive. However in winter months, you'd probably have to shut a vent down to prevent your phone from overheating from heat coming from the vent. So if your car is unable to turn a vent off, this might be a bigger issue.
- The motion lock system seems a bit weak compared to other mounts. I haven't had any issues from it, but it is worth noting. Basically even when tightened all the way I can still move it, but not without a bit of effort. This is double edged, as I can still move it without loosing it, which is good, but it can potentially move without input over time should it ever loosen even the slightest.

Overall this is a great car vent mount. The minor issues I have with it are really non-issues for me, as I have a Bluetooth system, and most cars today are either Bluetooth or use USB to connect for audio. If you don't you might want to consider that before buying. However if you use a dongle at the USB/Lightning port, it should be fine. I'd fully recommend this product. It is a solid mount and I don't see many points of failure at this time.

1884,2041,2041,This Is The Best Pet Door Made To Date,"There are pretty mixed reviews about this product so I'm going to try to clarify a few things.  As other people have indicated, there are a couple different versions.  The original version has a clear door with an extruded &#34;range&#34; knob whereas the newer version has a frosted door with a flush &#34;sensitivity&#34; knob.  Some have complained about the older version.  I received the newer version so can't comment with that respect.  There are actually 3 different versions, though.  Lowe's sells a version of this door which is &#34;iris&#34; compatible.  This is a replica of the newer version of the door but can be distinguished by one additional &#34;4th&#34; blue LED as the leftmost indicator marked &#34;link&#34;.  I lucked out and got the &#34;Lowe's&#34; version of the door.  As such, here is my review accordingly:

This door is excellent.  Some complain about range, intermittent ID recognition failure, magnet strength, binding, installation, etc., none of which I have noticed.  If there is a range or recognition failure, it is probably caused by RF interference in the area.  Mine works great and has not &#34;forgotten&#34; any of the 3 keys.  After experimenting with a number of different pet doors, this is by far the best weatherized model I have had.  It stops heavy winds and has no problems with binding or jamming.  The rigid door makes a huge difference over the rubberized flaps.  I ensured that the hole was square when I installed it, which is probably an issue for some.  Correct installation is obviously a necessity.  If the door is un-level or not squared appropriately, I can see a problem with binding.  Mine is installed in an insulated steel door.  Framing and mounting this through a wall would not be difficult, even without the tunneling kit sold separately.  The doors frame is plastic so when the installation screws are installed, the door could easily skew if the hole, level, or square are incorrect.  This would absolutely cause binding or jamming, as the door actually slides down into a channel to fully &#34;lock&#34; or secure.  The door is pretty quiet, except for a rather loud &#34;pop&#34; when it lifts from the channel to unsecure.  It scared the crap out of my Dingo for a few days but he got used to it quick.  Now the two dogs and cat have learned that the &#34;pop&#34; means it's time to push.  Yeah...if you didn't catch that...my 4lb. cat can easily open the large version of this door, but the wind does not stop it's reset.  Now that the functionality is explained, I'll go into the Iris part.

Just for entertainment, I got the matching &#34;Iris&#34; hub from Lowe's which is a Zigbee and Z-Wave radio home automation controller.  Not only does this allow you to switch from &#34;Automatic&#34; &#34;Locked&#34; and &#34;Unlocked&#34; modes from a smartphone or PC (locally or remotely), it monitors which animal (based on the collar transmitter) exits or enters.  You can look at the &#34;activity log&#34; in the Iris app or website and see which animal went &#34;in through the door&#34; or &#34;out through the door&#34; and when.  This is a pretty cool feature which has a ton of practical application, even if you don't realize it at first. (ie. it's now pretty simple to see if the kids actually let the dogs out).  I should note that, although it is annotated nowhere in the documentation, I have determined that the internal radio for this door is Zigbee, not Z-Wave.  If you purchase it with the intent of using it with a Z-Wave controller, it will NOT work.  Lowe's convolutes these systems with &#34;Iris&#34; by selling both Z-Wave and Zigbee devices and not bothering to tell you what product is which.

There is a lot of room on the inside of the device also.  I wanted to add an alarm sensor into the door and it was exceptionally easy to add a wireless reed switch based sensor inside the frame, using one of the built-in magnets as it's motivator.  They should build this ability into the door, but it would require too many different versions for compatibility, as there isn't a single protocol for wireless alarm inter-compatibility.  It was remarkably simple to add a Honeywell/Ademco 5800micra sensor.

The door has now been running on a cheap set of 4 &#34;D&#34; batteries for 2-3 months and hasn't dropped a bar on the &#34;Iris&#34; battery monitor.  I would speculate that the version without the Iris transceiver has even longer battery life.

I have a 50lb Dingo, 75lb Siberian Husky, and 4lb Siamese cat.  None have a problem operating this door.  It is solidly constructed, albeit all plastic, and reliable.  If you get the correct version, install it correctly, and aren't a complete and utter moron, I am confident (after my personal experiences) that you will be more than happy with the door.  This door is well worth the $75, $100, or $229.00 (version dependent) that is spent on it.

1885,2042,2042,Much better than expected....so far. **Updated--still great**,"I reluctantly purchased this doggie door after reading all the terrible reviews, as a last resort.  We are a family of cat lovers who inherited a dog when a family member passed away and are learning to live with him.  He had a doggie door his entire life before us but when we took him in we chose to try to train him to ask to go outside so our cats didn't get out.  We spend 2 years trying to train him and all we ended up with is a wall in our hallway that needed sheetrock replaced because he peed on it repeatedly and LOTS of frustrations.  We decided to try a regular doggie door and see how our cats did going out because we couldn't find any electronic doggie door with even semi-good reviews.  The cats loved going out but one started roaming too much and another one loved to hunt and brought us lots of half dead animals (lizards, mice, moles and SNAKES).  We also had 2 stray cats decide to wander in our house in the middle of the night.  Waking up to a strange animal in your house is no fun.  I include these things for anyone considering a traditional doggie door who has never had one.

On to the Petsafe electronic door.  We ended up having our handyman install the door so I can't really comment on installation.  We were installing in a metal door and didn't have the tools to cut through the door so I didn't even try.  I had read a comment on here about making sure the door was level and passed that along to him.  He said he put it in and was having a bit of trouble getting it working right so he loosened the screws and re-leveled to get it working.  This makes me think being level is quite important, as would make sense for a swinging door.

We have had this door for a week now and it is working great for us.  It makes a pretty loud click when it unlocks.  This scared the dog a bit in the beginning but he is used to it now.  He has to be in the range for about 15 seconds for the door to unlock.  The range can be adjusted so maybe it would open quicker if I adjusted it but I like it taking him standing in range for a bit for it to unlock so it doesn't unlock every time he walks by. In the beginning he would try to get out the door before it was unlocked but has now learned to wait for the click to know it is unlocked.  To teach him to go out the door I held the door open and showed him it was just like his old doggie door.  When I tried to get him to go out on his own he didn't seem to understand that he could open it by himself as this door seals tightly unike a flap door.  I gave him a little nudge from behind a couple of times to push his nose into the door and he quickly realized he could open it this way.  Next, I stood outside the door and gave him treats when he came out, then moved back inside and did the same.  It took about 5 days for him to get really comfortable with the door but now he uses it just fine.

We have not had any issues with the door not opening when it is supposed to.  It has not gotten stuck once.  It closes quickly behind him and locks in about 15 seconds.  So far our cats have not tried to go out behind him, but I do realize this is a very real possibility.  The door is pretty loud when it locks/unlocks and swings so thus far the cats have only investigated from a distance.  So far we love the door and it has saved my sanity (I couldn't take another half dead animal coming in my house, my kitties roaming off and getting injured, or another midnight visit from a strange animal) but, I am still a bit skeptical.  With so many bad reviews I am just waiting for this thing to break any day.  I will update this review if my opinion changes from my current 5 star rating.

****Update August 6, 2012****
At this point I would give this product more than 5 stars if I could!  We have not had a single problem with it, I'm not sure if this is luck on our part, but I'm not questioning it :-).  It has never gotten stuck or locked our dog out or in.  I had to change the battery in the collar today.  A red light came on on the collar unit to notify me it was dead, I replaced it and it worked just the same again.

One of our cats has learned to go out of the door, in fact he has trained the dog to let him out when he wants out (it took him about a month to figure it out).  He will meow at the door like something important is going on until the dog comes to check it out.  The dog then stands there confused trying to figure out what the cat is yelling about and unlocks the door for him.  As soon as the cat hears the click he is out the door!  Whoever said dogs are smarter than cats hasn't lived with both ;-).  This really hasn't been an issue because he always comes back quickly and hasn't yet trained the dog to let him in so I have to let him back in (the doggy door is in the garage so I know he always has a safe, cooler place to go) preventing him from bringing any of his half dead prey in the house with him.  Our other 2 cats still have no interest in going near this door even though they used to go out the regular doggy door all the time.  I think the noise of it still scares them, they are both more timid than the fearless hunter who has it all figured out.

If you are like me and questioning this door because of the terrible reviews, I think it is definitely worth a try, just make sure you are precise in installing the door.",5,B000WJ0IGU,"I reluctantly purchased doggie door reading terrible reviews, last resort.

1886,2043,2043,It takes patience but it works,"Just got this door installed this week so my dogs can keep using a dog door for yard access and my new cats can not. We hired a handyman and used the $100 wall tunnel as well, so this was not a cheap endeavor. I’m well invested to make it work. My dogs are both old and have some issues. One dog was having trouble stumbling and getting stuck with the old flap door anyway because his hind legs are weak. Both dogs get restless at night due to cognitive decline and like to go in and out of the door. I couldn’t see us waking multiple times at night to open the door. To say they were intimidated by this new door is an understatement. I was worried but I gave treats and showed them that each time the noise of the door unlocking happens, the door is able to be opened. Kept my voice upbeat and helped them several times. My more senile dog actually got the hang of it first. I think he just has more patience since it takes him longer to do anything whereas our girl is faster and more agile so expected the door to immediately open. After a couple days she has learned the noise means the door is open. She taps her nose on the door and I think she thinks this triggers it to unlock. lol It’s pretty cute. Now they are going in and out. The only downside so far has been how much noisier their in and out nightly trips are with the new door. But so far the cat has shown enough fear of the noisy new door that she’s stayed away. I was concerned that the door stays unlocked long enough for her to follow them out and get herself locked out there which would be horrific in our rural desert. I also ordered the Pawz away collar and disk for the cat and we shall see if that helps too. With this product we are supposed to put the disk by the dog door and her collar gives a correction shock to keep her away from the disk further making it known the dog door is a not fun zone.
The other con is that I fear we will go through a lot of D batteries which are expensive. I had to pay $20 for an 8 pack which may last one to two months. I also had to buy batteries for the dog keys as well as an extra key for the dog collars fo prepare for when the dog key breaks. I have seen my dogs lose plenty of dog tags so I know it will happen and they will be stuck outside. I did find some collars that have a little pouch. I think that will be a good idea to keep the key safe on the dog. More trustworthy that those flimsy key rings. Just know you have to be prepared for all these little details.

1887,2044,2044,"Great doggie door, no regrets (UPDATED)","I was really worried about spending so much money on this door with so many bad reviews.  But I have a middle-age dog that has never needed a doggie door before (who now really needs one) and a cat who is only indoor.  I am out of the house at work for most of the day and my dog needs to go out during the day and it seemed like my only solution for keeping the cat in, was trying out this electronic doggie door.

I just installed the door yesterday.  I will update this review after both my cat and dog have time to get familiar with the door.  My cat absolutely has to be indoors and my dog is the only one who should be getting out.

Other reviewer concerns:

Keeping the doggie door level so it doesn't jam:  My instructions said to mark the door at my dogs shoulder height while the door is still hanging.  Once I marked her shoulder height I made a horizontal line across the door with a level.  You have to do this while the door is still hanging on it's hinges.  Once I took the door down I lined up the shoulder markings on my door with the outline that came with the doggie door. This is the only way you will ensure that the doggie door is level and will not jam.  After I cut the hole in the door and put the doggie door in place I used the level again for minor adjustments before fully tightening the screws.  The door is perfectly level now and we have not had any issues with jamming!

Other reviews mentioned the door locking their pet in or out:  My door seems to stay open as long as the sensor is in range.  Once my dog is out of range it seems to lock after about 15 seconds.  This is very helpful for training.  My dog was a little unsure about the door her first few times through it and I was worried about it cycling and locking - making training harder.  But it stays open when she is near and does not lock until she is out of range (2.5 feet).  It's only been 24 hours and my dog seems to have learned that the clicking sound the door makes when it unlocks, let's her know it's ok to go outside.  My only concern about the door staying open while she is in range is that she normally likes to lie down by this door - so if the door stays unlocked, my cat may have a chance to slip out.  I will let you know how this works out when I updated this post...hopefully I can train her to not lie down by the door anymore.  As for my cat, I plan to keep her in my room while I am away for the next few weeks while my dog gets used to the door.

Noise: The unlocking sound the door makes is a little loud.  It's just about as loud as the sound of closing a washing machine door - maybe a little quieter. The door ""pops"" loose when the dogs sensor is near and lets the dog pass through.  The noise does not bother me - I figure at 3:00 in the morning I can either have my dog bothering me to go outside or I can just hear the popping noise when she let's herself out...I'll take the popping noise.

In all, I am very excited about this door.  I really hope it works.  I'm tired of coming home and finding my dog's stinky little ""surprises"" around the house.  :-)  I have only given the door 4 stars at this point because I am still skeptical at this point with all the bad reviews.  If things continue to go good and my cat stays indoors, I will upgrade to a 5.  Follow the instructions precisely and absolutely make sure the door is level - this will make your installation go right the first time.

Good luck!

PS - Have caulk handy after installation to fill any gaps in the door (my door has some beveling that I had to fill in).  This will help against water damage and bugs.

--------------------3 MONTH UPDATE---------------

After 3 months of having this door and what seemed like forever in getting my dog trained to use it - I love this door!  She goes in and out all of the time and seems to love that freedom.  She goes out just to sniff around and comes right back in!  I am so happy for my dog to have that type of leisure.  She lets herself out at 3:00 in the morning, she let's herself out while I am at work or when I run errands.  And no more accidents!!  I could not be happier!  And I know my poor pup did not like having accidents either - I don't have to see her guilty little face anymore!!...and my kitty runs freely through the house and has not made it out once!!  The doors locks when it should, like a charm.  On New Year's Eve we were away at a friends house for a VERY long time, so much that I worried that I had to run home to let the dog out - but then I remembered I did not have to.  I came home when the night was over and my house was clean and my doggy was happy.  What a relief!",5,B000WJ0IGU,"I really worried spending much money door many bad reviews.

1888,2045,2045,This WILL NOT last you.  Customer service won't care.  And goooooodbye energy savings.,"DO NOT IGNORE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!  There is no way this door will serve as anything more, than just a temporary solution.  You WILL be searching for a new one soon, and might as well have flushed your money on this down the drain.

Just go with a regular doggie door.  I found immediately that there was 0 reason to buy something electronic over manual, by about the second day.  And after a year and month, I came home to find the door snapped off, and a wide gaping hole in my door.  Whoever designed this decided it was a great idea to make the hinges plastic.  Well give those some time in the sun to get brittle, and you too will come home to find a hole in your door.  Upon contacting customer service, I received &#34;Well it's past the year warranty, so there's nothing we can do.  We'd be glad to help you buy another.&#34;  Sure.  Let me spend another $100 to buy a year's worth of non-holed door.  Yeah I get it...it went past the year they covered it.  But those plastic hinges WILL go out, and this company knows that.  WHY get this one and guarantee yourself another doggie door expense in a year or two?  What's worse, you'll have cut a hole in your door for this thing, and will have to worry about cutting a new hole for another brand.  Because I guarantee you will be buying another brand.

-After thinking it was the most amazing invention ever that I needed to have, I found no need for the electronic feature on this door.  Nice in theory, not so much in practice.  If you attach their collars, you will hear the door snapping loudly open, and then closed, every single time the dog is anywhere near.  That wouldn't be so terrible, if this thing wasn't a battery vampire, and the sound of the snapping didn't signal dollars flying out of your pockets.  4 massive batteries, every 3 or so months.  And that was AFTER I shut off the automatic feature, and only opened/closed it manually twice a day.  If you buy this door, it will be sucking that money out of you for as long as that lasts (fortunately....that shouldn't be much more than a year). More than likely you'll be like me, grow tired of the automatic feature, and just open close it on your own...so why not save the battery money and just get a regular doggie door?  Who needs such a high maintenance doggie door?

-My door flat out snapped OFF.  I could almost guarantee yours won't last much longer without the door snapping off.  But even if it didn't break in that manner, it's only a matter of time before the electronics go out on it.  So why add additional things that can go wrong?  If you're going to be manually telling it to stay shut, or to stay open (as I was), then you might as well just get a manual one, and never have to fear the day a gear is going to go out.

-It's drafty.  I must have lost a few hundred bucks in heating / cooling on this thing (no really.  I was bewildered at first, and called the electric company to yell at them about it.  &#34;I haven't changed my habits from last year to this!  I never saw a bill above $70 before, now I can't seem to see anything below $100!  You crooks!&#34;).  &#34;Locked&#34;, merely means the door will move down, and a few teeth will lock in at the bottom so it doesn't swing anymore.  It is NOT sealed around the edges.  If you are a prude about having an efficient home like me, you'll despise feeling the cold pouring into your house in the winter, and the air conditioning pouring out in the summer.  All they had to do was put some plastic sleeves on the sides for the door to tuck into.  They didn't.

Just don't bother folks.  Buy a quality manual one, and be done with doggie doors for the remainder of the time you're in that house.  I bought a Perfect Pet All Weather door to replace this (more expensive though), and that thing is awesome.  Muuuuuch better about being sealed.  And if I want to close it?  Just slide a sturdy piece of plastic into the holders.  No more worrying about how I'm eating through another 4 batteries.  No more worrying about the day it stops working and leaves your dogs locked in/out.  Furthermore, they sell slides that have alarms on them to let you know if someone opened it.",1,B000WJ0IGU,"DO NOT IGNORE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS! There way door serve anything more, temporary solution.

1889,2046,2046,Works well but doesn’t keep your cats inside,"I do like this locking dog door. Works as expected, though there was a learning curve for my dogs figuring it out. It is noisy when it thinks about locking it back up or unlocking the door. It does keep the air drafts out compared to a regular dog door. The reason for 3 stars is it completely failed for the reason I bought it. I actually bought this in an attempt to keep my two cats inside and it was a hard fail for this purpose. There is a very looong delay from when a dog goes outside and away from the door to when it would lock. There is an option to adjust the sensitivity of it picking up the collar tags, but no way to shorten the length of time it takes to lock. Soooo does not work for cats. They just wait for a dog to go through, check to make sure no one is watching and slip through long before it locks again. And something to consider is if you have a dog who likes to sleep on the back stoop outside the door, it will constantly pop open and closed every time they move. I’ve started leaving the door unlocked when I’m home so it doesn’t drain the batteries at an astronomical rate. But that’s my annoying dog’s fault, not the door.

Very happy Petsafe stands behind their product, even after the warranty period expires.
I purchased this doggie door in October 2020 and installed it in the door from my porch to the backyard so the pooches can come and go as they please, but the cat can’t get out and climb the fence as he’s prone to do.  One of my 3 dogs was scared of the unlocking “pop” and never learned to use the door.  But she passed away last January and the two other pups are fine with the sound.  Sometimes my smaller dog has a hard time getting the door to recognize when she wants back in, but eventually it will open.  The worst aspect of the door is the 4 D batteries, which need replacement every 3 months since my pups use the door so much.  Not being one to turn down a challenge, I purchased a 6V 3A power supply and soldered leads to the battery terminals.  No more buying expensive D batteries and worrying about the locking my pups in or out when the batteries die.  It wasn’t easy getting the soldering iron back onto the negative terminal, but it is working great so far.  If you do this, make sure the inside of the adapter connects to the positive lead (closest to the front on the left side of the battery chamber).  Use a multimeter to check polarity and ensure good solder joints.  Cut a small piece off the battery chamber door and install strain relief to protect the wire.  Run the wires along the hinge side of the door to the top and leave plenty of slack where the wire jumps across the hinges to the door jamb.

1891,2048,2048,So much potential but ultimately a fail for me. Would not buy again.,"This is gonna be a long read. So grab a frosty beverage and some popcorn and hold on tight. Or scroll past because this won't be particularly witty but it'll at least be informative. I'll try to throw some levity in for good measure, though.

So, I really wanted to like this. No, I wanted to LOVE this. It's basically the only ""security""-minded dog door on the market that's easy to install and readily available. So, I'll lead with the good stuff: the Pros.

Pros:
- It technically works. Well, it *technically* works TOO well, in fact. More on that later.
- It was fairly easy to install.
- It looks about as good as you can expect a giant, beige, plastic dog door to look. But it won't win any style points and you won't see it at the Consumer Electronics Show or Paris Fashion Week.

And now is where I get in the real meat-'n'-potatoes: the Cons. I'll break them down into subcategories for ya so you can more easily digest the dumpster fire I'm about to throw your way.

Cons, Part 1: Superficial Things That Make Me Look Like a Primadonna
1. The SmartKey tag for your dog's collar is enormous for what it is and does. It's meant to hold a battery akin to watch battery and contain the RF transmitter, but the thing is way too big. It looks like a plug for a large ice chest. It's klunky, looks stupid on my dogs collar, makes lots of noise despite my best efforts to silence it with velcro instead of a typical metal ring. Overall, it's like the design of this piece of the kit was a complete afterthought. Billy in ""Design"" was like, ""Oh, shoot, guys! We completely forgot how the dogs are supposed to open this thing! What should we do?"" And his boss was like, ""Who cares? It's just a dog."" Send 'em back to the drawing board because it just sucks.

2. It's loud. When it ""unlocks"" it makes a fairly loud ""Pop!"" Like, we can hear it from literally every room in our 1300 sqf home covering two floors. It even wakes us up in the middle of the night. (More on this later, too.) This is good and bad, sorta - but really, it's all bad because the door just doesn't work as intended.

3. It comes in two sizes: Teacup Chihuahua and Pygmy Horse / Great Dane. Yes, small and large. That's it. There is no medium size for those of us with medium-sized dogs. You know, like the VAST majority of dog owners. The small is so tiny don't even think about anything bigger than a small Jack Russel getting through. So we had to go with the large for our 44-pound dog that's only about 18"" high at his shoulder. But that's not all! Because this door is just so suitable for larger quadrupeds, medium-build adult males can also fit through the dog door with no problem. That couldn't possibly be a security risk. No way! But huzzah! What an unexpected treat to allow most of the adult male population access to our home! Also, more on this later.

Cons, Part 2: Radio Frequencies and the Physics-Defying Dog Door.
1. The door doesn't work as advertised. At all. So here's the deal. The door is supposed to have variable sensitivity. Not sensitive at all means the dog is, in theory, directly in front of the door before it pops open. Medium sensitivity means he/she is like, oh, some arbitrary distance the manufacturer states. For fun, let's say it's 5 feet away. Then at high sensitivity, the dog can be up to 15 feet away or something. Again, the number seems arbitrary and makes no sense. It's like that show ""Whose Line Is It Anyway"" hosted by Drew Carrey were ""the rules are made up and the points don't matter.""

So when you initially set it up, the instructions make you go through this sorta ridiculous process of putting your dog's collar on your leg then pushing a couple of buttons on the door then adjusting this silly little sensitivity dial then walking by the door to make sure the door unlocks. Honestly, you'll look like a total fool when you're doing this. Just make sure nobody's around. At any rate, I do all this. Follow the directions to the ""T"". All seems great. I put the collar on my dog with the supposedly perfect sensitivity level and the thing doesn't work. I had it set so it would Pop! and unlock with doggo about 5 feet away. Now, on Trial #1, he's standing right in front of the door and pushing his head against it and nothing. Finally after 4 seconds the door decides to cooperate.

I go through the process again. This time I figure it needs to be more sensitive to get past that weird little schism we just had. I'm giving this piece of junk the benefit of the doubt. This time it unlocks about the same place as last time. Success!? Hahahaha. No. Silly me. A broken clock is correct twice a day, right? Next time doggo tries to go out, it doesn't unlock at all. At all. Makes no sense.

So I conduct an experiment to find out how screwed up this thing is. I go through the initial setup process again to set the sensitivity. I do it for three settings: lowest, medium, and most sensitive based on the silly little sensitivity dial. To keep things as scientific as possible, I hold doggo in ""the staging area"" at the base of the stair and call him to the dog door via the same route the the kitchen each time. I do this ten times for each sensitivity level and mark/measure where he is when the dog door Pops! So 30 times (I'm not joking - I really AM this determined) I did this. At the end of the 30th run on the highest sensitivity level where, presumably, the door should Pop! from as far away as possible, I noticed three things:

a. No two successive tries at any sensitivity level yielded the same results. The first run it'd Pop! at 4 feet away. The next run it'd Pop! at 10 feet. The third time it'd Pop! only after doggo was sitting in front of the door for 2-4 seconds.
b. There was not even a grouping for each sensitivity level that would indicate a rough distance that would correlate to the specific sensitivity level. All three sensitivity levels were seemingly random for when the dog door would decide to Pop!
c. The distances and associated graphs for all three sensitivity levels could be interchangeable. All three were so randomized for the data showing when the door decided to Pop! that clearly the sensitivity dial is merely for show. The dial is a lie!

2. Because the dog door clearly does what it wants, it's a good thing (I guess) that it's quite loud. It alerts my dog that he's free to pass through the flap during the many, MANY instances where he's standing in front of it and the door doesn't work. It's like some twisted Pavlovian trick that I'm putting my doggo through every time he has to pee or poop. Seems almost cruel...I can only imagine doggo thinking, ""Will the door open? Will I be able to go outside to pee? Will I have to pee right here? I don't know!!"" Keep in mind, this has happened since Day 1, so this isn't a battery issue. It's a cruddy product issue.

3.Also because it's so loud, we can hear it when it opens on its own in the middle of the night. Yes. In the middle of the night. The same door that won't open when doggo is right in front of it somehow thinks it's appropriate to Pop! at 2 AM, then again at 5:30 AM. During these times, doggo is of course in bed. His bed is at a vectored distance of about 40 feet from the door. Vectored because his bed is upstairs in the northwest corner of the house whilst the door is downstairs in the southeast corner of the house. Also keep in mind that there's multiple plaster walls (I know...plaster is the WORST!) and a plaster ceiling and hardwood floors. I literally have a hard time getting WiFi signal to where his bed is when the wireless router is even closer than the dog door. That's not how physics and radio frequency propagation works. There's no way on this planet that his collar is activating it. And no, it's not their neighbors dog because they don't have dogs. This also happens during the day, again, when he's nowhere near the door. Over a 7-day period I counted the times the door spontaneously opened. It averaged 5 times per day. That's assuming we heard all of them. Which we probably have because it's so loud.

This is problematic for three reasons:
a. The whole point of this stupid door is to keep unwanted critters out and let out/in only those magical beasts with the Collar of Dreams. We have lots of nocturnal animals (raccoons and the link) in our neighborhood as well as a particularly amorous feral tomcat that has shown a Pepe Lepew-like affection for our female (inside only) cat. A door that pops open on its own is not a good thing to have in this scenario. Also, raccoons are creepy because they have human hands. And they're jerks because they go through our trash.
b. It wakes us up in the middle of the night!
c. Remember how medium-framed adult human males can fit through this thing because the manufacturer apparently decided we were too dumb to want options? Well, what a great way to break and enter! Well, really, it wouldn't be breaking and entering because the terrible dog door would just welcome them on in! Like I said earlier, not a security risk at all! /s

So I've done a lot of complaining here. And I think it's all pretty warranted. These guys have a corner on the market with this thing so it feels like they just kinda punted it and figured consumers have no other options, so they can totally turn out a garbage product. Does it work? Yeah, I guess so. Sorta. Which is why I gave it two stars in stead of one. But I would provide this feedback to anyone who was considering buying one. It's expensive and it won't work as advertised. Caveat emptor.

If you've read this far, thanks! You're a trooper. Think twice about this purchase. Maybe just resign yourself to the fact that you'll have to take little Winston or Pepper or Spot out twice a day instead of cutting a giant hole in your back door for a dog door of marginal quality.",2,B000WJ0IGU,"This gonna long read.

1893,2050,2050,"PITA, but the only option we could find.","The installation on this was a real pain, and I hope they change the design to make it easier.

It all comes down to the studs. This dog door set would probably work fine when installed on a door. We got the extension piece by the same manufacturer that allows it to go into a wall. Our wall, drywall, studs, and stucco on the outside. We were installing this in a wall that had a smaller dog door that was installed.

The kit with the extension is basically three parts, interior face, exterior face, and a little bit of the extension. Everything fits between two studs, so 16 inches. The exterior face that comes with the extension (instead of the one which came with the original kit) has screw holes spaced out far enough that the screws should go into the studs. The interior face (the part with the flap and electronics), has screw holes which are 15 inches apart. This is a problem because the screws don't come in contact with the studs, so they won't attach properly. If you cut the drywall any shorter, the screws aren't going into anything other than drywall, and the extension won't connect.

How we made it work: if the  screws just were up against something plastic and flat, it would be much easier, but they go into anchor holes in this hollow bulbous plastic shell. Instead of putting the screws in straight (and not hitting studs, we angled them about 45 degrees towards the outside and while it slightly chewed up the plastic making essentially a new hole, it did actually catch the studs. It looked like it was going to chew up the face of the frame, but it really didn't. The plastic bent enough as the screws went in that it worked. It only took us about three hours of messing around, shimming, and trying different things to get it to work, so hopefully this saves someone out there some time.

Is it weatherproof? Sort of??? We're going to have to use about a tube of silicone to seal everything up. Also, since the interior face is basically flat, and that's where the flap is, and the exterior face and tube just leave a sort of...cave? that's the thickness of the wall. We're in the Southwest where it doesn't rain that much so we're not worried. We might take the top 3 exteror screws out and put a piece of thick shower curtain or something on the outside and put the screws back in, sort of making a secondary flap.

Lock feature? It locks for sure. The basic functionality of it seems to work.

IMPROVEMENTS THEY COULD MAKE:
- Design the interior so that the screw holes line up with studs.
- For the 3 lights (locked, unlocked, automatic), always leave one light on so you can tell from a distance what state it's in. We'd like to be able to just have it be automatic when we're at home, not all day long. Also, when you're training the dog, it'd be helpful to visually see if it's locked so the dog can tell which light means they can go in and out (or the people can tell).
- Remote for humans to switch modes would be AWESOME.
- Timer for modes would be very helpful
- Exterior flap to keep the elements out would be helpful in many climates.

Will it allow our cat without a collar to get out when the dog goes in and out? Will it keep out unwanted visitors? Don't know yet since we've just installed it.

If you buy this, good luck.",2,B000WJ0IGU,"The installation real pain, I hope change design make easier. It comes studs. This dog door set would probably work fine installed door.

1925,2084,2084,A ~GREAT~ Product! -- Ergonomic; Precise; Compact; Great for getting those hard-to-reach areas; & Safe for Delicate Finishes,"The OXO Good Grips Electronics Cleaning Brush is a must-have product for cleaning electronics. It is versatile enough to work in many different applications. It is gentle enough to avoid cosmetically damaging delicate electronics that other brushes can easily scratch. And it is precise enough to work well in applications where one needs a tool of precision that is capable of reaching difficult or small areas.

I purchased this because it's hard to get that dust/dirt off that can accumulate between the keys. Many brushes (including some tooth brushes) are a little too stiff and in some cases could even cause a problem. This OXO Electronics Cleaning Brush presents a solution. At about the length of your average-sized pen, and about the thickness of a highlighter, this brush is compact. Like other Good Grips products, the body is wrapped in a silicone material which gives your hand excellent traction. It has two different ends: a soft-bristled brush, and a silicone wiper with a chisel tip. The brush is retractable via a slide lock, where as the silicone wiper is fixed and protected with the included clear cap. Since this protects both sides from damage, this brush can hold up to heavier mobile usage.

The uses for this product are almost endless. The brush bristles are extremely soft (think even softer than soft paint brushes) and are good for usage on finishes that can easily scratch (ex: acrylic.) The silicone wiper's chisel tip gives you incredible precision when working with smaller electronics/components. Like the brush, the silicone wiper works well on surfaces that are easily cosmetically damaged.

With an excellent design, useful features, great ergos, and a reasonable price, I highly recommend this brush.",5,B07V9J9S76,"The OXO Good Grips Electronics Cleaning Brush must-have product cleaning electronics.

1926,2085,2085,Perfect for cleaning keyboards! (and other delicate electronics),"This handy little tool does exactly what it's meant to! I use it to clean my Mac keyboard since dust and tiny little particles have a tendency to take shelter under the keys. I love the two different ends which you'll find many different uses for. The silicone end is great for getting in between the keys, but it won't be able to pick up everything underneath the keys because it can only go so deep. However, I find that the the bristle side does a great job of accomplishing this task. You can angle the brush to get under each key and you'd be surprised at how much gunk comes flying out. This does cause the bristles to fray a little after prolonged use but it is so worth it seeing how clean my keyboard is. Besides, at such a low price, I wouldn't mind buying another one if need be. However, I don't think I'll need to because it still works great.

I also use this to clean the charging and headphone ports on my cell phone, and I'm sure you'll find many other uses for this tool.

Dust does cling to the silicone side (which is kind of the point), but it comes with a cap to protect when not in use, and you can clean it easily by just rinsing with water. Same goes for the bristle side.

I have been using this product for several weeks and it still works like a charm. I keep this in my pen holder on my desk and it blends right in, and I can easily access it to clean my keyboard once I see that it's getting dusty again. My keyboard has never been happier.

Overall, very satisfied with the product and would highly recommend it.",5,B07V9J9S76,"This handy little tool exactly meant to!

I bought this as an add-on item with the intention to use it on my camera and the keyboard of my laptop, but I must say, I hardly ever use it at all. It's not that this is a terrible product, it just does not do a particularly great job. The little brush sweeps away some light dust, but it feels like it just pushes it around rather than trap it and get rid of it and it is clearly incapable of taking off anything more substantial or dusting anything out of small ridges and corners. I assume that the silicone tip is supposed to take care of that, but to my surprise, it did not. Over all, this product did not really perform to my expectations. When I used it on the outside of my camera, it did not get even a tad cleaner, and I would definitely not feel comfortable using this on the inside of my camera or lens.

The results on my keyboard were better, but I think that has more to do with the fact that a) I never take my computer to the woods etc. and b) My expectations are a little lower when cleaning my keyboard.

I have some experience with nicer binoculars (my main pair are Nikon Monarch 7 which cost about $500), so I have a decent frame of reference for what a good binocular should be. While these are not at the level of my Nikon Monarchs, they do surpass the optical quality of my Nikon Prostaff P3s (at least in my eyes) which cost around $150. The build quality is not as good, however it isn’t bad, especially for 20 bucks! Optically these are super sharp, they do lose clarity around the edge of the glass, but that is the case with most sub $1,000 binoculars so I hardly consider this a drawback. My main critique isn’t of the product’s functionality, but more-so that I wish there was an 8x25 option in addition to the 10x25. This is minor though and the 10x25 perform WAY above their price. If you are considering these as a main binocular, or as a solid backup, get them. You won’t be disappointed.

I like the fact that it is inexpensive and has a lot of tools.
I dislike the fact that it is of low quality. Some reviewers already mentioned that it broke easy. But, I still wanted to try it. I was super careful not to use too much force. You know what, it is this exact same blue tool that broke. This tool feels very brittle. This product just arrived like 10 minutes ago. I am debating whether to return it or not. I don't think I will return it because it takes so much energy to ship from China to my house. When I opened this product, everything was brand new (see attached). Even the box is nicely sealed (see attached picture).
What did you use it for?
I used this cheap tool to remove the back cover on a cheap Amazon Fire Tablet HD 10.
Result:
I did successfully remove the back cover and fix the problem.
Recommendation:
Should you buy this product?
I guess it is ok to try your luck for $10. It is like flipping a coin. Head (no break). Tail (break).
Somehow, I feel that the chance of getting a tail (brittle/broken tool) is higher than 50%.
If you value your time or want a quality tool, I don't recommend this product.
I am really regretted for not buying a better quality tool for $5 more.

A couple of CAVEATS of which to be aware: 1). They send you a big bag of soft replacement tips. The tips bend after a few games and need to be replaced. DO REPLACE the tips for greater accuracy. 2). The unit's electronics did stick (failed to work) one time. I discovered to look for two things - dart tips broken off in a hole and any numbered panel sections pushed back and jammed. The grandkids think they have to throw the dart like a past pitch baseball. I'm teaching them it's more about control and accuracy. The hard throws did cause a tip to break off in a hole. I simply pushed it through to clear the hole. Plus, one of the numbered panels was wedged back. I took a pair of fine tipped tweezers and carefully jiggled the panel free. Everything worked perfectly again after that. It's still going strong.
OPINION: Overall, this is a great unit and gets lots of use. It's fun to play. I can recommend it. Also. look into getting a laser line marker.

2155,2326,2326,"Far Superior Product, and a lot of fun!","I've recently gotten into throwing darts, and found myself enjoying it.  Years ago, we bought my son a cheap electronic dartboard for Christmas, which he never used.  So I went and dug it out of his closet and mounted it on the wall.  It was exciting at first, and the whole family began to have fun throwing darts together.  There were several problems with it though.  The biggest problem was that within just a short amount of time, the voice announcing players, scores, etc., started sounding fuzzy, and finally just quit.  Occasionally, the computer would reset itself in the middle of a match.  We would get many MANY bounce-outs.

Since we were having such fun throwing darts as a family, and since I had mentioned that I would be interested in getting a better board, my wife bought me this one as a surprise.  It arrived nicely packaged, and easy to set up, with a clear instruction book.  We love that it plugs in to the wall, so batteries getting weak will have no effect on game play.  The cabinet is very nice looking--so much so that my wife approved mounting it in the living room!

The games are many, and easy to select!  Also, you can select between 1-8 players, or even up to 4 teams.  There are 7 loudness levels, and the hits are always recorded correctly.  The voice is clear and easy to understand, but sometimes the synthesized voice makes you laugh, like the way it says ""four.""  Doesn't affect the game though, and actually provides a bit of entertainment!  It has two slots spaced 16"" apart on the back to hang directly on studs, and then it has four other holes that are accessible from the front, which I put black drywall screws through.  This secures the entire set-up to the wall very well, and makes it worry-free when removing your darts, or opening and closing the cabinet.

The only thing that was sub-standard were the shafts on the darts themselves, which is why I left a 4/5 star rating.  They were the normal, cheap plastic shafts, connected to some nice metal barrels.  One of the plastic shafts actually arrived broken, and two more broke on our first night of play.  It wasn't that big of a problem, because we already had some other darts to substitute to continue play.  With this in mind, I'd recommend buying yourself a set of twelve aluminum dart shafts with rubber washers at the same time you order this board.  They're less than $10, will hold the flights more securely, and you won't have to worry about them breaking.  The rubber washers will keep the shafts tight to the barrels, and make the whole set very nice to use.

Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this dart board!  In my opinion, it's worth the price tag for how it looks, ease of operation, and quality of the product.  There are far fewer bounce-outs with this board compared to my old one, and the variety of games and options are far superior.",4,B0CPLT7TYW,"I've recently gotten throwing darts, found enjoying it.

2162,2333,2333,6 Rats and Counting since May 30,"I really apreciate this new, more advanced electric rat trap! It's my second time to buy a trap that electricutes, and this one has all kinds of improvements over the last one (which was an early model from a different brand). I LOVE that this one can be plugged into an electric cord/outlet! Well, with a USB adapter. I was a little annoyed at that, but I had an adapter of USB to normal electrical connection on hand so I was fine, but some people may not have this and then you're fully reliant on batteries.

It's June 7, and I put my trap out on May 30. Have killed 3 adults, 1 young adult and 2 smaller ones. Very happy with this result as they were getting out of control after a wet spring.

I've used so many kinds of traps the last 20 years, but this one works best so far. The benefit of this unit: 1) It's a bit longer, wider, and has a front entry that makes the rat turn left and go a bit deeper to find the bait, and is designed so that it's harder for the rat to turnaround and flee when the unit is triggered. But it's still too small to endanger dogs, most cats or other mammals except maybe squirrels. 2) It can be plugged in so I don't have to worry about changing out batteries after every trigger (like the old one). 3) It beeps loud enough to let me know it was triggerd that I could hear it from the garage while inside the house, and also flashes Green so you know for sure. 4) Has a bigger bait compartment that doesn't open outward so I can put a big glob of peanut butter (my rats ADORE peanut butter) and not worry about the them breaking down the door like they did the old trap.  5) The top plastic cover is a good addition in case there's any weather. 6) The controls are easy, one sliding lever, that tells you quickly you're plugged in and it's setting. Then a minute or so later there's a beep that lets you know you're good to go.

One of the things I remember from my early experince with electric traps (years ago) is that rats can learn what to avoid. I'm pretty sure after seeing their buddies get fried a couple of times, they avoided both the one on the back porch and the one in the garage.

So, with this excellent new model from Owltra, I set up only the one trap in the garage, and near an area I'd seen their poop (yuck, I know). They don't come into the garage in numbers like outside, just one or two at a time, so the full group can't see the electrifying results. I bait the trap with a large spoonful of peanut butter, sprinkle a few bits of seed like birdseed or maybe granola on the floor around the unit as a lure to the area, and make sure the electrical cord is out of the way. Every morning I check the trap, and every time when it has signaled it's been triggered, there's a dead rat (100%). I wear long leather gardening gloves, remove the plastic protective cover, flick off the unit, (suggest to unplug also for safety) remove the top part of the device (a little tricky) and take the bottom part with the body and dump it in the grass beside the open field next door.  It's gone by nightfall as various predators come and go. Turns out quite a few creatures will eat fresh dead rat. (yuck, I know). Afterwards, I use Windex and papertowels, and clean the metal and plastic of the bottom tray so there's no smell of death and it's ready for newcomers. I only topped up the peanut butter once so far, but I do sometimes take a stick to stir it a bit so the next rat smells it better. I did notice that the smaller rats  weren't fried as quickly and got to eat a bit more bait, probably their weight didn't trigger the unit like the heavier ones. But, I still got them.... which is all that matters to me!

I prefer the electricution method as it's more humane than the sticky mats where the creature can slowly starve to death or you find a way to kill it (yuck!)..., or poisoned wth warfarin and slowly bleeds out internally... and then kills birds (owls, hawks) and other predators who eat the poisoned rats (secondary poisoning). (see recent story on favorite owl in Central Park, NYC that was killed in part due to rodenticide) The next most humane trap is the one that snaps shut tightly and breaks their neck. But I had an experience once where the creature didn't die immediately.  All it took was one time where I had to listen to the piteous cries of the creature in pain and terror, and that was it for me. Although, since it was still alive and wiggling, the hawks had a nice bit of easy prey. But... yuck.",5,B0BKLJQC4D,"I really apreciate new, advanced electric rat trap! It's second time buy trap electricutes, one kinds improvements last one (which early model different brand). I LOVE one plugged electric cord/outlet! Well, USB adapter. I little annoyed that, I adapter USB normal electrical connection hand I fine, people may fully reliant batteries. It's June 7, I put trap May 30. Have killed 3 adults, 1 young adult 2 smaller ones. Very happy result getting control wet spring. I've used many kinds traps last 20 years, one works best far. The benefit unit: 1) It's bit longer, wider, front entry makes rat turn left go bit deeper find bait, designed harder rat turnaround flee unit triggered. But still small endanger dogs, cats mammals except maybe squirrels. 2) It plugged I worry changing batteries every trigger (like old one). 3) It beeps loud enough let know triggerd I could hear garage inside house, also flashes Green know sure. 4) Has bigger bait compartment open outward I put big glob peanut butter (my rats ADORE peanut butter) worry breaking door like old trap. 5) The top plastic cover good addition case there's weather. 6) The controls easy, one sliding lever, tells quickly plugged setting. Then minute later there's beep lets know good go. One things I remember early experince electric traps (years ago) rats learn avoid. I'm pretty sure seeing buddies get fried couple times, avoided one back porch one garage. So, excellent new model Owltra, I set one trap garage, near area I'd seen poop (yuck, I know). They come garage numbers like outside, one two time, full group can't see electrifying results. I bait trap large spoonful peanut butter, sprinkle bits seed like birdseed maybe granola floor around unit lure area, make sure electrical cord way. Every morning I check trap, every time signaled triggered, there's dead rat (100%). I wear long leather gardening gloves, remove plastic protective cover, flick unit, (suggest unplug also safety) remove top part device (a little tricky) take bottom part body dump grass beside open field next door. It's gone nightfall various predators come go. Turns quite creatures eat fresh dead rat. (yuck, I know). Afterwards, I use Windex papertowels, clean metal plastic bottom tray there's smell death ready newcomers. I topped peanut butter far, I sometimes take stick stir bit next rat smells better.

2163,2334,2334,It worked great for me.,"I was over run with mice, and I think I saw a couple rats as well.  I couldn't be sure, because I read that rats and mice don't mix.  But, I do think that a couple of rats got in there.  This caused me to order the rat sized trap, because, what if Mama Rat showed up?  It was like a horror show.

In the past, I have tried snap traps.  These will get you one or two, until the rest learn how to steal bait without getting caught.  This time, I didn't start with snaps.  I just jumped to glue traps.  Glue traps work for the most part, if you buy ones with the strongest glue.  But if any part of the mouse can catch a solid edge, then they can pull out of it.  In addition to this draw back, they don't die right away, but linger for a couple of days.  You have to bash them inside of a bag to avoid this grisly detail.  And that is just as bad as having them sitting there suffering for days.

I moved on to electric mouse traps.  Yes, this is a successful solution.  The trap I bought is only meant for indoors.  I was very careful with it, not wanting to get zapped myself.  The directions are well written and easy to understand, except it is not clear which way to push the slide button to turn it on.  Slide the toggle toward the back door to turn it off, and towards the opening to turn it on.  The green light signaling it is on only flashes once for about 5 seconds.  If you don't see it, just repeat the steps.  Turn it off, then back on.

The back door is vented.  I once saw a mouse attempt to open this door, but he couldn't.  Don't waste your time thinking that you add the bait here.  I think that's what it's for, because the bait tray is right there.  But, I didn't use peanut butter, and my bait wouldn't fit through the opening.  It was much easier to add bait through the top.  I do not think human scent ever deterred those guys from going for the bait.

Let's say you're all set up.  This trap takes 4 C batteries.  1.  You turn off the trap.  2.  You take the battery door off.  3.  You take out one or two of the batteries (I always took out two.)  4.  You take the trap top off.  It comes apart using two hands, but so easy!  5.  You put the bait in the bin.  6.  You put the top back on.  This can be done with one hand.  This trap is well made and the plastic parts are thick and sturdy.  7.  You put the two batteries back in.  Put the battery compartment door back on.  8.  Turn on the trap and watch for the green light to flash.  Bingo, you're ready to go.  You can do all these steps very quickly.

I use a green pellet poison bait, the kind you buy in a bag.  They love this stuff.  I have one pellet in the trap.  For some reason, this trap worked better when the pellet was not in the middle but on the left of the bin.  I don't know why.  Maybe they could smell it better.  I always put another pellet right in front of the open entry way.  The height of my trap kept me from seeing the alert flashing light, so whenever I saw this green pellet was gone, then I looked for the flashing light, which meant that one of them had entered the trap and tripped the circuit.  I caught 12 of them in a row, one by one.

The first one I ever caught scared me really bad.  The trap set off with a sizzling sound, and the terrible smell of burning fur.  It scared me so bad that I brought a fire blanket out to keep near the trap.  I didn't need it except for peace of mind.  I don't always hear the sizzle, but you can.  The mice don't make any noise, because they are dead.  When you go to dispose of them, all you have to do is go through the steps above and take the top off.  The body can be dumped into a bag without any mess.  If you smelled burning fur, you might see that left over, but no body mess at all.

I had one incident of the trap being tripped without a mouse in there.  Then again I saw this once:  A mouse came flying out of the entrance, hit the side of the phone sitting there, and fell off the bookcase all the way to the floor.  He disappeared somewhere, not dead.  He did learn to fly.  So, I think there's something about the mechanism that scared them so bad that they jumped out, avoiding getting fried.  That only happened twice.  I dunno.  I'm not sticking my fingers in there!  The bodies are always near the bait bin.  The bodies are bloated immediately, like kernals of corn popping.  But, they are intact.

The difference, I think, between the mouse-sized trap and the rat-sized trap, except for size, is the length of time the circuit remains on.  Mice get one-half the amount that rats get.  I can't remember how long the rats get zapped for, except I remember that it's twice as long as for mice, which is 90 seconds?.  This could account for the burning fur.  There were no flames or char marks or anything like that.  Nor was the mouse stuck to the floor.  So, although it is disconcerting, I think it is safe.  It also could be that the batteries were new, and now they are worn down a bit, although still working well.  Less sizzling, but effective.

I was surprised this trap worked so well.  I think I got them all, but I'm keeping the trap ready to work just in case.  Always wash your hands well, although you never have to touch the rodent.  I'd buy this again.  It's us against them, and I am not living with mice in my kitchen and walls.  This is my home, and I'm protecting it.",5,B0BKLJQC4D,"I run mice, I think I saw couple rats well.

2164,2335,2335,Almost perfect,"Recently have been noticing some rats in the backyard. I bought a snap trap that said it was humane, but it wasn’t killing the rats immediately and they were suffering. So, I tried to find an outdoor electric rat trap. There seem to be 2 on the market. One made by the big guys, and this one.
First off, the good:
1 - it kills rats. In the week it’s been out, I have caught one or two a day. They have been killed almost immediately
2 - it’s easy to clean. It’s a tiny bit awkward to get the top off, but once that is done, you just dump them out
3- the batteries seem to last longer then a previous indoor one I had
4 - it is water proof. I have had it out in the rain. It’s against a wall, it’s a bit protected, but still gets wet. Once when it got really wet, I took the pieces apart and left it on the covered porch to dry

The bad:
1 - it seems to only work with smaller rats. With the snap trap I caught a couple of really big ones. Everyone here has been relatively small. I think it’s the size of the unit.
2 - I wish the bait station was a bit different. I am using peanut butter. If i put it right in, it’s hard to clean. So I have been putting it in a bottle cap. But, that makes it more difficult when I am disposing of a rat. Also, it attracts a lot of ants. My ideal solution would be to make the space bigger (maybe twice as wide as it is now). I would like it fill it with water, and have the peanut butter in the middle. Hopefully this would still attract the rats but prevent the ants.
3- when it kills a rat, the unit beeps and flashes. I find the beeping is really, really annoying, and the flashing isn’t really visual enough. Something like a little red light on the top (that stays on) would be interesting.

Overall, very happy with the product. I would recommend it and will probably buy another one.

EDIT - Today, I was checking the trap. When I put the lid on, I think a piece of grass got caught in it and it started ""zapping"". I stupidly touched the top, thinking I would seperate them and it would stop zapping. And, I got zapped! So, I guess don't touch the unit if it's zapping.

2165,2336,2336,It works!,So last Tuesday I purchased this trap and waited for it to arrive later that day. I had had enough and my apartment complex wasn't doing a damn thing whenever submitting pest control work orders. I so can't wait til my lease is up in 3 months to move.  When it came I set it up immediately and didn't catch anything right away (a bit disappointed but I didn't wanna give up) so I left it overnight guess what? Success! The next morning my boyfriend checked and the light was flashing indicative that a mouse had been caught. He moved it out of the living room to the kitchen where we would see them often. I think that's why it didn't work immediately because I had it in an area they didn't frequent. I baited it with cashews and trail mix and over the next day we caught 3 more. By Friday we had successfully caught 4 w/ the trap 1 w/ poison we had set out a few days before purchasing the trap. It had eaten so much it had come out & died on the kitchen floor gross🤮. Anyways its the following Tuesday and we haven't seen or caught anymore mice. I hope we got them all but if not I got the fresh cashews ready to go in the trap lol. Get this trap it definitely works!

2166,2337,2337,Outsmart those smarty-pants NYC mice,"I’ve never been able to catch a mouse in NYC.  If you live in my building you’ll have to seal up every crack of the apartment if you don’t want mice to get in and ruin your day. They can out-smart any mouse trap, glue trap, glue board, sonic alarm plugin, and apparently even some of my copper mesh in cracks.  It’d be quiet for a year or two, then suddenly go the opposite way, with full-on army of rodents taking turns scurrying in to rifle around the joint the minute I’d  shut the lights off at bedtime.  I’ve been at wits end, dealing with this for twenty years.

In comes this contraption.  I bought the double trap set and still had a low level of faith, what with my experience in the past of them ALWAYS getting the bait, never getting caught.  These are mice of all sizes, from cotton ball to small rat.  So before using these traps as instructed I decided to try another tactic and suggest it to anyone here who has a similar past mouse experience.  Mice in NYC are too smart to get caught, and I felt they’d figure out some way to snipe the bait even on these things, or simply avoid it altogether.  I had to try something new, I had to think like them, so follow my lead:

1.  Place nice bait in the traps and leave them out without batteries or power.  My first four days those mice were like heck no, I’m not touching that thing, it’s a trap.  Day five, bingo, both traps were clean as a whistle inside!  I was so excited.

2.  So now days 5-8 I placed gave all sorts of goodies: candy, muffins, chocolate toffee crusted pretzels, PB, or combos of this.  Twice a day (each morning I’d wake up, each evening home from work) I’d open the trap, joyful to see cleaned out bait trays, and reset with more feasts inside, (welcome all hungry mice, bring your friends!)

3.  Day 9:  Now that I had the mouse crew trained as to where the good stuff can be found, I finally loaded the traps up with batteries inserted good bait, powered on and later returned to have my first two mice, (one in each trap) laying there inside all cute as if having a catnap.  They appeared to be very serene, no signs of suffering, which made me feel better.  Then I caught one more, then I caught another one.  So, 4 mice in two days.  [TIP: Since I worried the other mice might smell death, I cleaned the traps out with white vinegar before resetting with new bait and disposing of the victim.]

I’m so pleased, and actually came back to see if I could buy more traps, it’d be more efficient, but again I will still do the ‘free food’ time period again since they’ll be in a different location of my apartment, and well, you know, the mouse is a creature of habit.  Some new contraption in its path is going to raise its suspicion, so, no, we’ve gotta have the multi day Happy Hour, meaning, ‘Buy none, get all free!’ deal in order to train them, again where to find the best goodies.

2167,2338,2338,Best trap ever.,This trap is a mouse killing machine. I have several electronic traps but this one is my favorite. Every time I hear it beeping it has a dead mouse in it. It is simple to use and I've probably killed about 20-30 mice in it so far and its still charged and killing with its first set of batteries. I've had it about 6months now and at least 1 or 2 times a week it lets me know its got a kill. I dump and reset and wait for the next beep. The other traps are not as good because of 2 things. 1) they don't beep and i have to check them all the time and 2) 2 of them have a stairway that the mouse has to climb and a tiny hole to get in. Ive not caught a single mouse in these and they were 2 times the price of this one. I recommend this trap over all others.,5,B0BKLJQC4D,This trap mouse killing machine.

2168,2339,2339,See my video! So far so good. I set it up!,"So I purchased this mouse trap because I have a mouse in my laundry room. I did some research and was looking for something that would be safe for my three cats. I didn’t want any poison or anything that would snap closed and leave a dead mouse in front of my cats. I didn’t want them carrying a dead mouse in a trap, into the bedroom to surprise me. This looks safe so far and of course this has to be updated. It is a mouse trap and I just set it up, which means we don’t know if I’m going to catch a mouse, so stay tuned for the results. Watch the video clip. I was a little surprised that the “bait” area was not only small, it was a little difficult to locate. It’s a small square spot at the end of the chamber and it has the word “bait”written in black on black plastic, so be aware of that. It says not to get any food on those metal plates. That’s where the mouse gets electrocuted! (how gross)I’ll be back. Stay tuned. PS …when you see the green light, as it says in the directions, (which I do think or a little vague), the green light “doesn’t” stay on it “flashes”once when you turn it on, you can see in the videos that I am waiting for it to start flashing , and it doesn’t.  It only flashes “once” when you’ve caught and killed a mouse! so you can look over at the trap and if the green light is  flashing then you’ve made a kill!  I’ll be back to update! This could turn out to be a wonderful product and I will definitely let you know, so let’s  be fair ! I’m saying I just set up this product and I’m giving it a chance!

2169,2340,2340,Got one in the first hour,"So I was pulling out grass seed to winter seed our lawn since we were expecting a good amount of snow. Unfortunately a bunch of mice found the seed and made a nice home in the bag. I managed to toss out the ones in the bag (our trash can is mouse proof so they can go live at the dump if they live long enough), but there were more that made a home in a large bag of garden soil I plan to use in spring. That bag is too big and expensive to use toss out.

I ordered 2 types of traps, these and a 5 gallon bucket style that will arrive later and can handle larger numbers by resetting itself. There are too many for these to make a dent but wanted to start sooner, rather than when the other will arrive.

As soon as it came I set them up with some peanut butter. It’s easy to set and the tunnel design will keep pets from a snap when they try to have a taste, an important feature in this house.

An hour later I had to grab something out of the garage  and decided to check on them, not at all expecting anything, although hopeful.

Yeah! Got one! It was easy enough to dump the mouse and easy to wipe with alcohol to clean and reset. I’ve read they need to be cleaned with alcohol to remove any death scent, but don’t know if that’s true. Maybe that’s what keeps the other mice from eating the leftover bait that’s exposed after it’s been tripped.
Whatever the case may be we have one less mouse in the garage and I’m able to reuse the bait. Hope they keep at it and there will be a couple caught before bed and again in the morning. I’ve seen 6 or them so guess there are three times that at least.

I will say this may not work for really tiny mice as it looks like it snapped while the mouse was trying to leave, the tail and one leg could be seen when looking at the bait area, so it obviously was turning around when killed. Hopefully this won’t be an issue later on, but time will tell.

Overall I’m happy with trap and glad my dog can’t get snapped due to the tunnel design. This was the main reason I chose this style vs old school ones as I don’t care about seeing them.

P.S.
I love pet mice and rats but unfortunately these wild mice carry diseases that I don’t want my family and pets to get so they have to die.

2170,2341,2341,Expensive but more humane and worth it,"(This review is for the mouse version not the larger rodent or rat versions.)

You can buy a bunch of cheap snap traps for the price of just one of these electronic traps. I bought those cheap ones first but there were so many drawbacks to them I switched to these and I'm happy I did.

The first reason I didn't like the snap traps is that when they work you've got a (hopefully) dead mouse in plain view. I don't like walking into my kitchen and seeing a mouse carcass. With these traps everything is covered and out of sight until you're ready to deal with it. Yes the dead mouse is still there with these but I don't have to look at it until I'm ready.

Another reason I don't like the cheap snap traps is that you have to arrange barriers so that the mouse can get to them but pets can't. I have two cats and quickly found out the barriers need to be pretty big and heavy to keep the cats away from the trap and the caught mouse. Kind of a hassle when I needed to place the traps around my kitchen. But

But the biggest reason I switched from the cheap traps is that they don't always kill the mouse. Unfortunately, they sometimes just crush part of the mouse without killing it leaving it alive but suffering in pain in the trap until you notice it (which could be hours if you're away or asleep). I don't want mice in my house or garage but I also don't want fellow mammals to suffer needlessly.

These traps worked great for me and eliminated the mice that had infiltrated my house within 3 days. They are easy to empty—just lift off the lid and dump into a trash can. You don't need to touch the carcass, pry it out of the trap or even look at it. Quick and convenient and the trap is ready to go for the next mouse as soon as you put the lid back on and flip the switch.

I happened to be nearby when one of the traps caught a mouse. The trap emits a low whine or buzzing sound when it's activated. It's pretty quiet but I was able to notice it in a silent room. It stays activated for a while (I'd guess about a minute) to make sure the job is done. When it stops making noise after a short wait the light starts to flash to let you know it's caught a mouse. A previous reviewer mentioned a smell but fortunately there was no smell at all that I could detect.

I had no issues with non-kills; when the light was flashing on my traps there was always a dead mouse inside. I'd guess an issue some other reviewer may have had is if the contacts that connect the top to the bottom get dirty or corroded. The trap likely won't work properly if it can't make a solid electrical connection.

I have two cats and I wanted to make sure these traps would be safe around them. Fortunately, the way these traps are designed with the location of the opening and the internal barriers there is absolutely no way even the most inquisitive cat is going to be able to get a paw in there let alone have two different paws touch the two metal plates. (Without going into the details on how this type of trap works a mouse would need to contact one of the metal plates with a front foot and the other with a back foot in order to be dispatched.) There is no way even a small cat or dog could do that and the voltage and current likely wouldn't be enough even if they could. You don't need to worry about your cats with this trap. Obviously, though, if you have rodent-sized pets such as hamsters you'll want to make sure they can't get near these.

One thing I would change about this trap is to make the bait cup removable for easier cleaning and changing of the bait. What I did is put my bait peanut butter on a small scrap of paper and then put that down in the bait cup so that the peanut butter didn't stick to the trap itself. Another thing I would change is to have the trap self-test the connection to the bottom part when turned on. It should flash or something to let you know if the contacts are not making an adequate connection.

I'm very happy with these traps and definitely recommend them despite the high price.",4,B0BKLJQC4D,"(This review mouse version larger rodent rat versions.)

2172,2343,2343,ANC HEADPHONE COMPARISON: BOSE QUIETCOMFORT / 1MORE SONOFLOW / BEATS SOLO PRO / AIR PODS PRO,"I’ve owned & extensively used the Beats Solo Pros & Air Pods Pros.  I gave the Beats to my daughter as the ‘on-the-ear’ design was causing me pain on flights.  I migrated to the AirPods Pros hoping I’d get similar performance to the Beats with more comfort and less bulk on flights.  Ultimately, the Air Pods Pros just won’t stay in my ears and the ANC just isn’t as effective due to the lack of ear covers or better plugs.  So recently I ordered the new Bose QuietComforts and the 1More Sonoflows to compare.  I was hopeful on the 1More product due to being on sale for $67 and that the price savings would outweigh any deficits.  But ultimately I am going with the Bose QCs.  This is my personal opinion and what works best for me.  Keep in mind I have not extensively tested the Bose or 1More yet, but spent a day alternating between the two so this is based on initial impressions.  Categories are in personal order of importance.

COMFORT/DESIGN:  I gave up the Beats due to pain/pressure from prolonged use of the on the ear cups.  I am also not a fan of the Air Pods Pro design, nor getting them to fit in my ears well and stay (I love the original air pods, and I’ve tried multiple buds for the Pros).  I have a large head so the Beats had to be fully extended to be on my head properly which probably increased pressure.  They fit my adult daughter much better.  The Bose QCs don’t require full extension on me, completely cover my ears, and the cups are really soft.  The 1More product covers completely, and is comfortable, but heavier & puts more pressure around my ears than the Bose, so I’m skeptical if I’d want to wear them more than an hour or so.  The pressure is a drawback especially given the ANC performance noted next.
RANKING: Bose QC > 1More Sonoflow > Beats SoloPro > Air Pods Pro

ANC:  In my immediate comparison of the Bose QCs and the 1More Sonoflow, there was a large difference in noise cancellation.  I use an infrared heater in my office sometimes that is pretty noisy.  Comparable to airplane noise but quieter.  The Bose is very effective against it despite fitting looser than the 1More product.  But the Bose has less options than the Beats for ANC modes and I found the Beats to be slightly better at full ANC than the Bose and quicker to switch modes.  The Air Pods are at a disadvantage here being an earbud product but they are effective and travel light.  The 1More product was the worst performer on ANC for me.
RANKING: Beats Solo Pro > Bose QuietComfort > Air Pods Pro > 1More Sonoflow.

SOUND/EQ/APP:  I always found the Beats Solo Pros to be balanced, clear, dynamic and pleasant.  Integrated with Apple, they worked great though many audiophiles will complain about the lack of EQ adjustments.  I liked the simplicity of them and not having to have an additional app.  Same goes for the Air Pods.  The Bose Sound is very good, as you would expect from Bose, and their App is simple and ok.  Out of the box very good and you can tune them to preference.  The 1More Product out of the box is definitely at the bottom of the pile.  It had an almost metallic, chunky, machine sound to me.  You can adjust them, update firmware, and tune them with the app which made the largest difference in the performance compared to the others.  The app did have a neat white noise feature with some different options.  It also had twice as many EQ adjustments points over the Bose.  Ultimately, I enjoy the Bose sound the most followed by the Beats and AirPods and then the 1More, but once tuned all are very good, especially if ANC with music or video on an airplane are your target use.
RANKING:  Bose QC > Beats Solo Pro > Air Pods Pro > 1More Sonoflow.

PHYSICAL FUNCTIONALITY:  For me, I love the Beats functionality.  Buttons are intuitive and easy to use, typical tactile Apple design.  AirPods are similar.  So far the Bose is ok, it’s intuitive and the buttons seem like they will be easy to learn.  The 1More Sonoflow is last here.  All buttons on the right side, the power button in front doubles as a function button and for me it’s awkward trying to find it on the front.  The 1More is last by a bit for me here.
RANKING: Beats Solo Pro > Air Pods Pro > Bose QC > 1More Sonoflow

CASE:  Beats Case is cheap and not protective at all.  AirPods are AirPods.  The 1More Case fits but is a bit bulky, rounded, and the included accessory net is too small.  The Bose Case is well made, stiff, protective, has a large accessory net, and is rectangular shaped.  Personally I see it fitting in a carry on laptop bag or backpack much easier.
RANKING:  Bose QC > 1More Sonoflow > AirPods Pro > Beats Solo Pro

BATTERY LIFE:  This is of limited importance to me.  But it seems to get tons of mention in every online review you read.  The headphones all have insanely long run times compared to older devices.

2173,2344,2344,Really amazing,"I have had lots of $40-60 headphones in my life and a few that did noise cancelling, and these blow them all out of the water by a huge margin.

If you have some music on and noise cancelling enabled you will absolutely not hear your kids/wife in the same room unless they yell very loudly or happen to speak sharp/loud/quick at a perfect break in the music.  These should be more heavily marketed to fathers everywhere to allow them to get 30 minutes of peace after work.  Even without the music on it still blocks out as much noise as an average set of shooting earmuffs.

In the ""aware"" mode you'll hear everything in your life just as good as you would with a single headset off your ear and the other one on, playing music.

The bluetooth works great, connecting to multiple devices (phone and PC etc) at once with no foolish rules/policies that make it annoying.

The other reviewers saying you have to have an app to use these are definitely wrong.  You can install the app if you want extra features but you can also just pair it to your phone/tablet/pc like any other device and use it as-is.  That's exactly what I did and it works great with all the standard features you would expect.

Excellent hardware/buttons etc:
- L side button switches between NC and ""aware"" mode, great feature to have in an easy to hit button
- R side main button: single tap pauses whatever is playing, double tap jumps to next song, triple tap goes back
- R side volume up and separate volume down buttons intuitively located
- On button is also slide-and-hold for pairing: great feature that is impossible to do accidentally
- USB-C charging
- port to use hardwire cable to connect directly if you cannot understand the blueteeth thing or want to play something from a device that has no bluetooth or won't pair.

Favorite feature: plug in the 2' hardwire cable (which has a tiny but good inline mic on it) and let it dangle or tuck in a shirt pocket: you now have a top quality, silent, noise cancelling headset with a good mic (without changing any mode, hitting buttons etc) that allows you to talk on the phone in bliss.  Now instead of yelling at my kids to be quiet every 5 minutes that I'm on the phone, I just put these on and have a great phone call.

In the small house that we live in these have made my life a lot better and allow me to let my kids run around loudly having fun at times when I just want some quiet, and when I would have otherwise made them tone it down.

The only downside to know about is that these are effective enough to where you need to be careful not to use the noise cancelling when you have much going on that you need to pay attention to.  For example:  you would not hear your sink overflowing or a pot boiling over, I didn't hear my woodstove fire getting too hot the other day, you won't hear early warnings of kids having trouble (probably wouldn't hear choking etc but would still notice actual screaming nearby).  You would still hear something break or a loud whack etc, but probably wouldn't hear a vehicle pull up in your driveway.  It does to some extent take away a major ""sense"" so you can't use it as often as you might like.

For those other times, like if your wife is cooking and can hear the kids for you if there is trouble, and you just want to relax, I feel like I would almost pay the purchase price of these per week that I got to use them it is so awesome.",5,B0CCZC9J1V,"I lots $40-60 headphones life noise cancelling, blow water huge margin.

2177,2348,2348,"Wonderful sound quality, somewhat flimsy","I've had these Bose QuietComfort NC Headphones for about a month now, and I really like how they feel and sound.  For context, I have tried out about 5 different pairs in the last 6 years, starting with some Plantronics PRO's back in 2017, which i still use occasionally for travel.  Then I moved to some Sony ones which I did not like.  All of these other headphones were wireless and noise cancelling in the $100 to $150 range.  They each had some shortfall that made them hard to use.  Honestly out of all my previous headphoen the Plantronics were the best in quality and durability and Battery life.  Sony always had connectivity issues and would crash randomly.  Even the mid range model  WHCH710N which had a lot of issues.  They would randomly crash during zoom calls or listening to music.  Happened about 3-4 times a week, it was getting really annoying.

I decided to tier up my headphones because I use them for work daily.  I thought it was a worth while investment.  I decided to go with Bose because of the name recognition and because I have seen many of my peers use them (Im a Software Engineer).

My first impressions of the Bose headphones were :
- Light
- Easy to setup - reliable bluetooth connection (something Sony was lacking)
- Excellent sound quality (Best sound quality - on par and slightly better than my Plantronics)
- Comfortable (The most comfortable out of all the other headphones I've used)

To elaborate further.  A common pain point I've experienced is difficulty pairing and dealing with unstable bluetooth connections with my other headphones.  I rightfully assumed that this was a price point issue, because I have not had that problem with the Bose headphones.  The Bose headphones were easy to setup, they also have apps to help with it.  But you can use them without any apps.

They are very comfortable and fairly light, comparing to others i've used.  I sometimes wear these for 6-10 hours a day and I never have that weird ear pain that you can develop from wearing headphones for long.  I have very big ears so that is saying something.

Sound quality is excellent.  Deep bass with excellent sound range, very satisfying to listen to.  They also have a great volume range.  This is what Bose is known for so they definitely get this right.

CON 1:
They do feel rather flimsy.  For this price point I expected more metal parts.  The materials look well made and have excellent form factor.  The headphones however are completely plastic from what I can tell.  I feel like one good tug would snap the hinges on the ear pieces.  This is a serious concern when you're wearing lose clothing or a hoodie.  The headphone could get caught in the folds of your clothing and if were to pull hard or fast while going through the motions you might break them.  I have no data to back this up obviously because I am not going to throw away perfectly good headphones to test that theory but you can sort of tell by holding them and pulling on them a little.

CON 2:
Battery life isn't great.  If I forget to turn them off at the end of my work day they somehow continue to deplete the battery.  The following morning they are already at 50% battery.  So that is 50% a day with only 6-8 hours of actual work (active use).  For reference, my old Plantronics headphones last for several days without needing a recharge.  I have gone on to use them for 5+ days without having to charge them.  Even the mid-range Sony headphones perform ""slightly"" better than this.  I know it's good practice to turn them off after you're done but one forgets to do that far more often than one would think.  There is room for improvement here.

Overall i'd say these are excellent headphones with great sound quality and form factor.  Do take a little extra care because they are not the most durable headphones out there.  I am happy with. my

I bought these originally 20 + years ago for my husband (at the time), and he wore those things until they were falling apart, then gave them to our son, who replaced the pads and wore them another few years until he could afford a new pair of his own. He uses his constantly, and absolutely loves them.
I ""cheaped out"" and got some Sennheiser headphones a few years back, and they were very nice, but I eventually broke down and bought these Bose on sale late last year (always best to buy these when they're on sale), and the sound quality is just phenomenal. It did take some getting used to the feature differences (buttons vs. swiping for volume, etc), but truly my ONLY complaint was that I had to purchase the 2 prong airline adapter separately (these used to be included with purchase, and my Sennheiser came with one, but it doesn't fit the Bose). I travel internationally, and some airlines still require the 2-prong adapter. I just purchased one separately.

2180,2351,2351,HOLY MOLY !!!,"if you're in the market for noise-cancelling headphones then I suggest these! Bose is what we use at the private aircraft manufacturer I work at for the headsets in all the planes. The brand itself is fudging awesome and reliable as a son of a gun. Their main focus is sound quality and background noise cancellation. I've had Beats solos (club editions, solo 3, and Beats Pro earbuds), JBL (earbuds and headphones), and I've used several other brands claiming they're the best. Music is obviously very important to me, and I'm part-time in a home office, so I use headphones for meetings and videos. The only thing I could possibly nit-pick about them is that the Beats solo 3s have a much longer battery life, but these do last all day!! And they fully charge within 8 hours MAX. Also, they come with an AUX cord, so you can connect them to your compatible devices without Bluetooth! Recently, I bought the Bose QC 45 headphones in moonstone blue (color doesn't affect the quality of sound or anything but HOLY MOLY IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL), and HOLY CRAP!! They're worth every cent, I swear by them! I slip these bad boys on (no audio) and my fan (on high) TV (on 10-15/40-50), and all chatter and other background noises get wiped out immediately. It feels like your ears get plugged. (My dad and younger sister said the same!) When you play something in them it's crisp and clean-cut audio, and you can forget about hearing anything else with them on. I'm absolutely flabbergasted, that's why I'm putting y'all on these!! The Sony WH1000s are overrated like a son of a gun. If you're gonna pay $350 for any headphones, I'm begging you to make it these!!! I'm beyond happy, and I'm so glad I decided to buy these.

2211,2383,2383,Fixed my anxiety! Install is simple - read if you have trouble,"Truly an impeccable product. I’m a college student with multiple roommates in a large house, and privacy is a big thing for me — this has been the perfect fix to ease anxiety and ensure my room is only my room.

install was super easy. It fit directly on where my old doorknob was. Something to keep in mind is that there are two holes to screw the latch piece into the doorframe and it is essential that these work. My old doorknob didn’t require those holes, but thankfully they were already drilled.

Definitely get new batteries for this - don’t use ones you’ve bought and had for a while. I had some new Duracell’s that I purchased last year, and they were not good for this for whatever reason. It was great to find out the low battery beeping function worked though!!  A new pack worked perfectly. The first thing I did was turn off the beeping. It’s super loud, but a very quick fix.

The Master and user passcodes worked well. ADVICE HERE: Be sure to follow the instructions in order when setting up a passcode. Meaning you will use the default master passcode to set up a user passcode and once you have a user passcode, then it’s best to change the master (it’s the instructions directly below the user).

I was a bit worried at first when installing the hardware because the Little round latch thing that goes into the hole on the doorframe was turned the wrong way. All I had to do was remove both ends of the doorknob and then take out the middle piece, turn it the correct way, and then just push the two ends back together.

The battery install isn’t required until the last portion so no need to rush through it. You will have to connect the power supply into the tiny white socket in order for the device to power on, so inserting the batteries alone won’t just start it up. The two manual keys worked great. The auto lock function is amazing but I think one of big pros is the passageway option where it operates as a regular door until that is turned off by pressing ANY key.

I was skeptical the code portion would be overly tricky but the UX is genius. I was able to set up a custom code for one of my roommates in case there is an emergency, and removing that code would be super easy too if I ever wanted to restrict access after giving it out. Honestly this is an easy 5-stars.

As for durability, it’s awesome. Someone would legit have to break the door down to get it off, and there isn’t a way to unscrew it from the lock side.

As some have mentioned it is a bit bulky compared to the average doorknob. This didn’t bother me & I personally like it a bit excessive, but it is something to note bc it looks slightly funky and would be obvious that it’s not a normal knob.

Coloring on the knob and items are great. High quality. They keypad isn’t constantly lit but pushing any button lights it up.

Also something neat is being able to push a bunch of random buttons before entering the master code and AFTER it and the door will still open. This has allowed me to have the privacy of using my code in front of other people and them not knowing what it is because there are so many other numbers involved.  You will have to hit the check mark button after you enter your code to get It to open for this function to be possible and just in general. Just typing in your number sequence at any point without hitting it won’t let you in. Gotta push the check mark.

The auto lock is nice because I don’t have to manually turn something every time, which sounds like common sense but it is a nice transition and peace of mind so I’m never forgetting to lock it.

How the lock works is essentially when it is locked, turning the outside knob doesn’t move the Latch piece connecting the door to the doorframe. When the code is entered and approved, turning the doorknob will turn the latch like a normal door would. The opposite side always turns the latch as one would hope.

I don’t know why this item is at the price point it is. I’m guessing because of the bulkiness, but I wish I would have made this purchase way sooner.",5,B0CB38Z8PP,"Truly impeccable product.

2231,2403,2403,Best Photo Frame On Amazon & Excellent Customer Service,"This frame was the best gift that I have ever given my mom.

She was given a photo frame a few years back but it simply played images that were placed on it using a computer. Her vision makes this impossible. As soon as I heard about these new frames that allowed others to send pics directly to the frame I knew this was something that I needed to purchase for her. She lives 2500 miles from me but my brother brought her with him to attend a family wedding. This allowed me to actually see her reaction when the slideshow began. It started with pics of her and my father getting married , my brother and I being born, growing up, us having kids and everything else in order of when they happened. My the 2nd or 3rd photo she had tears running down her face. She is back home now and she receives photos just about everyday and she gets so excited to know that she received new images.

2233,2405,2405,Bought one as a gift and now I want my own!,"Ok this is a super cool frame! It exceeded my expectations. I bought this for my mom who is 76 because she lives in Florida and I live in Massachusetts and she misses my 7 month old son terribly. She isn't real big on using her cell phone anymore, so my husband thought this would be a great way to keep her updated with photos of the baby and events. She cried on the phone when I told her how I can upload photos directly to her frame in FL from my phone in MA &lt;3 so that made me so happy. What I didn't realize that I loved is that you can caption the photos. This is extra awesome because my mom is starting to have some memory issues and gets names mixed up, so I have already uploaded about 80 photos so far and was glad that I could add a caption so she will know who is who or how old my son is in the picture. It also says in the caption who sent the picture to the frame because many people can download the app to send photos to the frame. It shows the time and weather on the frame, but you can change that in the settings. You can change just about everything in the settings which I think is awesome. It's very user friendly, but doesn't give a ton of instructions in the manual so I mean myself at age 38 had a fine time with it but I typed up my own instructions for my elderly mom and stepdad. The picture quality is amazing and the white frame is pretty. You can stand the frame up either horizontally or vertically and the picture adjusts as you flip it. The person with the frame can also 'like' or 'love' the photos which is fun. I shipped this from MA to FL via USPS and it was around $13 shipped via ground (because it contains lithium batteries). It took about a week to arrive. Just adding that info in case anyone else is buying one to ship to someone.

2234,2406,2406,Great Upgrade from Our Prior e-frame,"This e-frame looks great, works great, is easy to use, and has a number of customer-friendly features.

We bought this frame as a replacement of a more basic model, and we've been amazed and impressed at all it can do. Anyone with the Frameo app and your unique code can send pictures to your frame--so you, relatives, and friends can ""post"" pictures. (You can approve pictures before they're displayed, of course.) You can also load pictures into the frame's internal memory via USB cable or an SD card. Once pictures are loaded, the touchscreen makes it easy to re-center or display them otherwise for the best view. You can modify the order in which pictures are displayed (e.g., random). Meanwhile, the frame can display the time and current local weather, and with a touch several days' upcoming weather. Our kids enjoy adding emoji reactions to pictures via the touchscreen (and their grimy fingerprints disappear in the brightness of the screen).

Save your money and just buy a regular power charger or a car charger if you prefer, but all this is to me is a not very good flashlight.

2272,2448,2448,Not anywhere near the advertised 40000mAh capacity,"Long story short, when testing this out it has potentially only 1/4 the capacity that they advertise. See below for the details.

My iPhone 14 Pro Max has a battery capacity of 4,323mAh. This power bank supposedly has a 40000mAh capacity, which is the reason I bought it. Being able to charge my phone nearly 10 times off this thing could come in incredibly handy in an emergency.

So I bought this a few months ago and tested it out and while the math didn't seem to add up, I knew I'd still get a couple full phone charges out of it so I didn't bother complaining, as I didn't have any other power block and it was certainly still useful.

A few days ago I decided to get another power block with a bit higher wattage, even if it was rated a smaller battery (25800mAh). Today I tested the two of them together.

Both power blocks were topped off at 100%. I used an app to drain my iPhone battery down to 80% and then plugged in one of the blocks and charged it to 100%, then did the same for the other block. I compared the time it took to charge the phone from 80% to 100% and how much juice was left on the power block afterwards. I closed out all my apps and had the same functions off/on, same brightness on my phone etc. and didn't use my phone at all during the tests. Here are the results:

-""40000mAh"", 30W power block (the product you're looking at): Took about 85 mins to charge my iPhone 14 Pro Max from 80% to 100%, and had 92% left in the block down from 100%. That means you'd use up about 40% of the power block charging my phone one time from 0% to 100%.
-25800mAh, 65W power block (the competitor): Also took about 85 minutes to charge my phone from 80% to 100%, and had 91% left on the block down from 100%.

Summary: The charge time was the same on both, and was done with a USB-A to lightning cable. My phone's battery, again, is only 4,323mAh. So in a perfect environment (which I'm aware this wasn't) charging 20% of that capacity means 864.6mAh was used, which brought the power block to 92%. That means the capacity on this power block you're considering would be around 10808mAh, or roughly 1/4 what it's advertised as. The other power block which is advertised as just over half the capacity of this one was nearly identical in power usage (1% off). The competitor still didn't add up to the advertised 25800mAh it had, but of course there may be other factors at play that impacted both tests (maybe the last ""20%"" of a phone charge uses a disproportionate amount of power, my phone was still on and technically using power as it was charging, etc.)

Even if you don't trust my admittedly barely scientific math in this quick test (which is understandable), the fact remains that a power bank advertised as 40000mAh only actually has roughly the same capacity as another power bank advertised as 25800mAh.

Now, the other power block I got is valued at twice as much as this one, so in that respect this is still a value. In the end the price is still good on this product, just make sure you're ok with not having anywhere near the advertised capacity. My star rating reflects the suspected false advertising of capacity from the seller.

2287,2464,2464,Impressive quality,"Everything about this well-designed and -presented FM radio kit shows high quality, especially as it's meant for children (8 years and older). For them, the value is in the learning experience and opportunity to derive great satisfaction assembling a well-crafted, functional device with meaningful results. For parents or the adult who purchases this item, the value is in how it's designed and the materials used. I received a radio kit back at the dawn of the transistor radio era (9 transistor AM radio) at it introduced me to a life-long hobby of amateur (Ham) radio, sustained by decades of electronic HeathKit building fun.

Likes:
~~everything--hardware, antenna, plywood case (no plastic), decorative graphics, fully assembled circuit board electronics, speaker (3 watts!), and the instructions (full color photo-illustrated directions), is of the highest quality.
~~the FM radio has just the right amount of functionality for the purposes of the kit--to provide a meaningful learning experience that produces a product that older children can use and appreciate.
~~the finished product is a small appliance with obvious utility, vs. a digital screen dependent device.
~~the two AA battery holder is on the outside of the back surface, making it easy to replace them.
~~the receiver specifications are sophisticated and advanced, using IC chips and electronic (vs. analog or mechanical) tuning and volume adjustments. The 3 watt speaker signals significant power output and high fidelity sound.

Reservations (minor gripes / concerns):
~~the case, being made of thin plywood pieces that interlock, is relatively fragile. I haven't assembled it yet (waiting to give it as a gift to a grandson) but I would recommend gluing the pieces together (except for the back) for added strength and durability. The assembled case would not tolerate rough treatment, so consider child recipient's ability to handle things carefully.
~~the excellently-illustrated written directions are quite clear and complete. There are the usual Chinese-to-English translated words that sound humorous (e.g., the speaker is called a ""horn"") but the written directions work, and they are in a relatively large font size.
~~I'm not enamored of the decorative graphics, although they are nicely printed in full color. They feature a little town with a windmill, and music-note-shaped bubbles, but I understand they are meant to appeal to a child, and be gender-neutral as well. The overall effect is to make it look like a colorful toy, when something a bit more serious and useful might be in order.

They can be challenging, and all of them require a steady hand with a light touch and lots of patience.

Couple of heads up. Keep all your puzzle pieces in a box. Some are quite small and it is very easy to misplace them. Don’t apply too much pressure, you can easily break balsa wood.

2291,2468,2468,Had a few issues,"I hate to give such a middling review, but this was more work to put together than I feel it should have been. Here’s why:

1) The directions were confusing: Frankly, it isn’t many parts, and you don’t have to be a rocket scientist, but that’s why it was so frustrating when we couldn’t tell by the pictures which screws we were suppose to use for which things. The photos were hard to see detail in. It would be nice if they had a parts ‘key’ and labeled in each photo which screws to use, or if you needed a washer.

2) The antenna had to be rigged to work by my husband because the hole for the screw was too big and wouldn’t work to hold the antenna in place. We tried both screw types and neither worked.

On the plus side, the radio does work and gets stations clearly, but it doesn’t last super long on just a couple batteries.

I’d say that, for the price, it would have been better just to buy a radio, even though the fun is suppose to be putting it together (and putting it together wasn’t fun).",3,B0CR1PYB1C,"I hate give middling review, work put together I feel been.

The kit itself is interesting and does produce a fully working radio at the end. The kit is attractive with nice graphics on the outside of the radio and a relatively clean looking finished product. The only real downside though is that it's a little too basic in my opinion. It's very much ""Tab A in Slot B"" type of construction. It's all based on plugging pre-cut, pre-connector added wires into a prebuilt board. There's very little that can go wrong so fewer teachable moments. When I built the similar kit when I was a kid, you just felt more like you were actually building a circuit rather than putting together something from Ikea.

As a kid I had a rocks and Minerals book and I would sit for hours and reading through it, looking at all the close up pictures.  I'd , mentally take journeys to the rocks native location and imagining how they were created over time, the chemical composition and bonds that formed the shapes and absolutely enjoyed those adventures over TV.

Fast forward and now I have a new book that fits more into my other hobby, Electronics.  The book shows  clear and detailed explanations with pictures of components I have used many times over the years, even the older versions.  The cut away view of each component shows the internal connections or materials and how they are made is really fascinating to see.  The pictures even show the inner workings of some of the more advances yet common components used in every day electronics.  Well worth the read.  For sure to offer a young person that final spark to make a choice into a long term career path.  Would recommend getting one for a office waiting room,  a  coffee table as a conversation piece,  or one just to have in that how does it work collection of books.  So happy I purchased this book.

My cats even like to curl up and read the book with me but I suspect it's for other reasons...  Amazon packed the book to me un-wrapped and without a protective bag in a box with two 15lbs bags of cat food.  By the time I received the order the book corners had ripped open one of the bags of cat food and the food was smashed all over the box leaving a oil residue on the book.  Luckily the oil was thin and wiped off the face of the book relatively easily.  The corners of the book received some rounding and have minor damage but nothing that regular use over time would also produce.

My desk is where my desktop and several other devices reside, each with it's own annoying LED.  There is, however, one LED on my computer tower (on top of which I keep a desk lamp which I use all the time when working at my desk) that is so bright that when I approach my desk in the dark room to reach up and turn on the desk lamp, I have to cover that light with my hand in order to be able to see enough to find the lamp switch.  When I walk into the room at night where my desk is, I am reminded of looking down while flying over Chicago at night, there are so many lights.  So I couldn't wait to test these blackout dims, and you guessed it, that big blue CPU light was the first to go.  You should've seen the smile on my face as I saw the light just disappear.  I quickly proceeded to cover the rest of the LEDs, and now walking into that room at night is a whole different experience.  And I don't get why some commenters here are saying that these do let some light through - I haven't had that issue at all.  And I didn't have to stack any dims to get the job done.

Also some have said that you have to be sure to apply the dims exactly over the light, as they are not removable to re-apply in the correct position.  I didn't experience that either.  I did use a tweezer to grasp a tiny edge of the dim to assist in placement, and this worked great.  And when I did apply it off-center, it was no trouble at all to remove and re-apply.  In one instance I applied a small circle, found it was slightly too small, and removed it and placed it back on the sheet for another time.  I can't think of a single thing I could possibly have against these dims.  There are more than enough on this 100-sticker sheet for my own use so I can share with a friend.  I will gladly recommend this amazing product to all.

I am impressed with the company also - it's a small family-owned business, a husband/wife/2 daughters.  They were right on top of my order, and I received it BEFORE the range of estimated delivery dates.  They also included a free gift, which was a dimming sheet that fit perfectly over my Kindle Fire after simply trimming off about 3/4"" from one end.

2314,2491,2491,Great,"These dimmer stickers are SO helpful.  I got the full black out variety and they fully black out the annoying/intrusive light.  The video is of my alarm clock which has a blinking center colon to count off the seconds, and it drives me UP THE FREAKIN WALLLLL.  I’ve always had the clock face toward the room rather than me which means I either have to get uncomfortable again to look at the time, or check my phone which inevitably leads to me staring at the phone for too long.  Since the numbers and symbols are under the surface glass of the clock a bit it was a good example since you can still barely see the covered light from a steep angle and know how blacked out the lights are.  I’ve also used these on several pieces of tech at work - in fact before I knew these existed I took a hole punch to some electrical tape and made a “dimmer sticker” for my old office phone (if only I knew there was a business in that!!).  These are less tacky than tape so it seems like they won’t leave marks if you remove them which is great, and come in a variety of convenient sizes, such as the exact size of my monitor buttons at work.

I also think it’s great that this product was born in the US and I hope the creators will be able to bring the manufacturing home soon, or at least are making sure their Chinese factory is one of the ones that doesn’t use abusive labor!

2377,2564,2564,This Book Lives on my Workbench,"Overall, this book is really great. It covers a wide range of topics. It presents some relevant theory and historical perspectives. And, it contains schematics of sample circuits and references part numbers of components currently in production. Keep in mind that the 3rd edition of this book was published in 2015 so there are definitely some more contemporary components out there but often they are still made by the same manufacturer.

One of my favorite parts about owning this book though is that it has often been quicker, less frustrating, and more illuminating than doing a simple online search when I first sit down to design a circuit. Of course, this statement should be treated with a caveat: I am not a professional electrical engineer. I don't have any educational nor vocational experience in analog electronics, and I'm not designing insanely complicated circuits. Most of what I have learned comes from this book, online forums, and technical datasheets from manufacturers.

Because of this, I would say it is an incredibly beginner friendly text for those designing circuits. It does contain math, uses technical vocabulary, and asks you to read a schematic/graph/table, but these are all well labeled, accurately defined, and clearly depicted. I haven't found myself lost because of a simple omission that the authors felt was too obvious to mention nor a poorly defined or ambiguous term.

2378,2566,2566,The most important and inspiring book on electronics there is.,"To me, there is no one more important book in my life than H&H.  I certainly do not know of a better electronics text (and I like electronics texts).
Further, I believe my career in engineering boils down to a few distinct pushes in that direction before it was in my blood (and therefore too late).  One of the big ones was getting a copy of AoE 2nd Edition in school.

So, I would have bought the 3rd edtion no matter what.

Incredibly, the 3rd edition has expanded many of the things I loved about the 2nd edition.  The section on low noise design is much better and much more useful and it was pretty great before.  The digital stuff is obviously much more relevant (although it may not stay that way).  The &#34;circuits from the masters&#34; sections and the case studies of specific circuit designs are fascinating and useful (although I do miss the hilarious &#34;bad circuits&#34; sections).

Finally, and most importantly, you can tell that H&H themselves were active engineers in the world between the last edition and this one -- building circuits and solving problems and reading other works and being influenced by the work and scholarship and generally just continuing to rule.  The dedication to Jim Williams showed that like me and all other analog nerds I know out there, they had been eagerly reading all his stuff.  The section on microcontrollers exactly parallels some of the design ideas, biases, and gut feelings that I and other embedded engineers have taken the past fifteen years developing by plowing through all the exciting architecture and tool changes that have happened from EEPROM PICs to ARMs.

Finally, the intellectual integrity, raw practicality, and HANDS-ON-ness of this book are unparalleled.  If everybody were required to read this book before designing circuits, there would be a lot fewer crappy circuits out there.

To the beginner, this is an intermediate level book. Though it does start off with basic concepts of voltage, current, resistance, inductance, etc., the underlying tone is that you should have at least some basic grasp of these concepts to begin with. Very quickly it starts diving into somewhat more in-depth discussions on these topics, but it is still kept at a relatively moderate level. My last calculus class was 20 years ago, and while it helps my understanding of what is going on (electronics is full of differential equations, can't really get around it) the way they present the math you don't have to derive the formulas, most of it is boiled down to relatively basic algebra and maybe a little bit of trig. If you want the derivations, they're back in the appendices, but the authors state early on that they try to keep the complex math to a minimum.

I have had the book for about two months and am still on chapter 3, mainly because I find myself having to go back and re-read some passages several times.

2394,2583,2583,This Victor trap works well for mice.,"After researching a lot of different mouse traps, we finally tried this electronic trap. I originally tried the Rinne Flip N Slide Bucket lid no-kill mouse traps where the mouse climbs on top of a 5 gallon bucket (not included) to reach a bait and falls through the trap floor which flips down into the bucket. There are a lot of knock offs out there that may work well, but I bought the original Rinne trap and it just didn't work for us. We had two set up in our basement where there was mouse activity and we did catch one mouse, but it escaped every time and that's because the trap floor, when closed, is not flush with the yellow lid and apparently the mouse can escape through small gaps. We put small pieces of almond in the back of the trap floor so the only way the mouse could reach it, was to walk back and the trap floor would flip down and the mouse would fall into the bucket. Twice the almonds were gone and we peeked in the bucket and saw mouse poop but no mouse.

So I gave in and looked for an electronic trap that would at least humanely kill the mouse quickly. This Victor trap is very easy to use and set up. You just put in four AA batteries (you could use rechargeable batteries but we used regular to try it out) in the top compartment which slides open. Then you put bait in the back of the unit. The instructions say to put peanut butter through the holes in the back of the unit. But the cleaning instructions say not to get the metal plates inside wet. I don't see how you can easily clean the unit without risking getting the plates wet. Especially when using peanut butter. Instead, we just put a small piece of cheese in the back. The power switch is on the top and after you turn it on, it will blink green a few times and then go dark and remain dark. When the trap catches a mouse, the green light will blink until you turn it off and remove the mouse. Note: When the trap has a mouse and blinks green, the green light blinks slowly, not nearly as fast as when you first turn it on. It's about 9 seconds between blinks. So if you're quickly checking on the trap from a distance, you should look at it for a while to see if it the green light blinks. Or, just go up to the trap and look inside because one end of the trap is completely open.

On the second night, we got a mouse. So it works and I'm ordering a second unit to put in another room in our basement.

Update: After setting up the second unit (both in the basement), we have caught a total of seven mice. So the traps are working consistently.",5,B0CQ8RTXRT,"After researching lot different mouse traps, finally tried electronic trap.

These include a universal charger for all their devices (phones, tablets, laptops, smart watches, whatever) as well as the corresponding cables for them. Instead of tracking down a handful of USB bricks around the house and cables in the morning before a trip, you chuck the little tech travel kit in your luggage and you don't have to worry about a thing!

So I bought this case for my mom to do this exact thing for Christmas. To my eyes, it looks smaller in the pictures than it did when loading it up. I also didn't realize it had two pockets. This is not exactly a problem for my mom that packs everything under the sun, but it's not as compact as I would've liked. I tend to stick to the 4""x4"" tech cases because they're big enough to hold everything, but small enough to not take up a ton of space. This one's a bit larger, maybe the size (though I didn't measure exactly) of a Nintendo Switch. Maybe a Switch Lite.

However, she'll leverage that extra space (and extra compartment) for *something*. And the aesthetic matches most of her luggage and travel bags, so it's a perfect match for her.

First note that it is not small or light.  The outside is padded/quilted so it does provide some protection, but that adds size and weight if you are packing.

This case has a combination of elastic pockets and a zipper pocket for small items that you don't want to fall out.  I prefer the elastic pockets to the plain straps.  The elastic straps never seem to be the right size to keep cables from falling out.

The zippers seem pretty large and durable, with large pulls on them.  They are unidirectional, so you cannot only open in the middle.

2463,2658,2658,Not anywhere near the advertised 40000mAh capacity,"Long story short, when testing this out it has potentially only 1/4 the capacity that they advertise. See below for the details.

My iPhone 14 Pro Max has a battery capacity of 4,323mAh. This power bank supposedly has a 40000mAh capacity, which is the reason I bought it. Being able to charge my phone nearly 10 times off this thing could come in incredibly handy in an emergency.

So I bought this a few months ago and tested it out and while the math didn't seem to add up, I knew I'd still get a couple full phone charges out of it so I didn't bother complaining, as I didn't have any other power block and it was certainly still useful.

A few days ago I decided to get another power block with a bit higher wattage, even if it was rated a smaller battery (25800mAh). Today I tested the two of them together.

Both power blocks were topped off at 100%. I used an app to drain my iPhone battery down to 80% and then plugged in one of the blocks and charged it to 100%, then did the same for the other block. I compared the time it took to charge the phone from 80% to 100% and how much juice was left on the power block afterwards. I closed out all my apps and had the same functions off/on, same brightness on my phone etc. and didn't use my phone at all during the tests. Here are the results:

-""40000mAh"", 30W power block (the product you're looking at): Took about 85 mins to charge my iPhone 14 Pro Max from 80% to 100%, and had 92% left in the block down from 100%. That means you'd use up about 40% of the power block charging my phone one time from 0% to 100%.
-25800mAh, 65W power block (the competitor): Also took about 85 minutes to charge my phone from 80% to 100%, and had 91% left on the block down from 100%.

Summary: The charge time was the same on both, and was done with a USB-A to lightning cable. My phone's battery, again, is only 4,323mAh. So in a perfect environment (which I'm aware this wasn't) charging 20% of that capacity means 864.6mAh was used, which brought the power block to 92%. That means the capacity on this power block you're considering would be around 10808mAh, or roughly 1/4 what it's advertised as. The other power block which is advertised as just over half the capacity of this one was nearly identical in power usage (1% off). The competitor still didn't add up to the advertised 25800mAh it had, but of course there may be other factors at play that impacted both tests (maybe the last ""20%"" of a phone charge uses a disproportionate amount of power, my phone was still on and technically using power as it was charging, etc.)

Even if you don't trust my admittedly barely scientific math in this quick test (which is understandable), the fact remains that a power bank advertised as 40000mAh only actually has roughly the same capacity as another power bank advertised as 25800mAh.

Now, the other power block I got is valued at twice as much as this one, so in that respect this is still a value. In the end the price is still good on this product, just make sure you're ok with not having anywhere near the advertised capacity. My star rating reflects the suspected false advertising of capacity from the seller.

2478,2674,2674,Impressive quality,"Everything about this well-designed and -presented FM radio kit shows high quality, especially as it's meant for children (8 years and older). For them, the value is in the learning experience and opportunity to derive great satisfaction assembling a well-crafted, functional device with meaningful results. For parents or the adult who purchases this item, the value is in how it's designed and the materials used. I received a radio kit back at the dawn of the transistor radio era (9 transistor AM radio) at it introduced me to a life-long hobby of amateur (Ham) radio, sustained by decades of electronic HeathKit building fun.

Likes:
~~everything--hardware, antenna, plywood case (no plastic), decorative graphics, fully assembled circuit board electronics, speaker (3 watts!), and the instructions (full color photo-illustrated directions), is of the highest quality.
~~the FM radio has just the right amount of functionality for the purposes of the kit--to provide a meaningful learning experience that produces a product that older children can use and appreciate.
~~the finished product is a small appliance with obvious utility, vs. a digital screen dependent device.
~~the two AA battery holder is on the outside of the back surface, making it easy to replace them.
~~the receiver specifications are sophisticated and advanced, using IC chips and electronic (vs. analog or mechanical) tuning and volume adjustments. The 3 watt speaker signals significant power output and high fidelity sound.

Reservations (minor gripes / concerns):
~~the case, being made of thin plywood pieces that interlock, is relatively fragile. I haven't assembled it yet (waiting to give it as a gift to a grandson) but I would recommend gluing the pieces together (except for the back) for added strength and durability. The assembled case would not tolerate rough treatment, so consider child recipient's ability to handle things carefully.
~~the excellently-illustrated written directions are quite clear and complete. There are the usual Chinese-to-English translated words that sound humorous (e.g., the speaker is called a ""horn"") but the written directions work, and they are in a relatively large font size.
~~I'm not enamored of the decorative graphics, although they are nicely printed in full color. They feature a little town with a windmill, and music-note-shaped bubbles, but I understand they are meant to appeal to a child, and be gender-neutral as well. The overall effect is to make it look like a colorful toy, when something a bit more serious and useful might be in order.

They can be challenging, and all of them require a steady hand with a light touch and lots of patience.

Couple of heads up. Keep all your puzzle pieces in a box. Some are quite small and it is very easy to misplace them. Don’t apply too much pressure, you can easily break balsa wood.

At some point in the construction, you will have several parts you try to mate to at the same time. I recommend taking them with a small piece of scotch tape until all parts come together.

1) The directions were confusing: Frankly, it isn’t many parts, and you don’t have to be a rocket scientist, but that’s why it was so frustrating when we couldn’t tell by the pictures which screws we were suppose to use for which things. The photos were hard to see detail in. It would be nice if they had a parts ‘key’ and labeled in each photo which screws to use, or if you needed a washer.

2) The antenna had to be rigged to work by my husband because the hole for the screw was too big and wouldn’t work to hold the antenna in place. We tried both screw types and neither worked.

On the plus side, the radio does work and gets stations clearly, but it doesn’t last super long on just a couple batteries.

I’d say that, for the price, it would have been better just to buy a radio, even though the fun is suppose to be putting it together (and putting it together wasn’t fun).",3,B0CR1PYB1C,"I hate give middling review, work put together I feel been.

It's all based on plugging pre-cut, pre-connector added wires into a prebuilt board. There's very little that can go wrong so fewer teachable moments.

2497,2693,2693,"Great company, great product!","When these arrived, I didn't waste any time applying them.  My desk is where my desktop and several other devices reside, each with it's own annoying LED.  There is, however, one LED on my computer tower (on top of which I keep a desk lamp which I use all the time when working at my desk) that is so bright that when I approach my desk in the dark room to reach up and turn on the desk lamp, I have to cover that light with my hand in order to be able to see enough to find the lamp switch.  When I walk into the room at night where my desk is, I am reminded of looking down while flying over Chicago at night, there are so many lights.  So I couldn't wait to test these blackout dims, and you guessed it, that big blue CPU light was the first to go.  You should've seen the smile on my face as I saw the light just disappear.  I quickly proceeded to cover the rest of the LEDs, and now walking into that room at night is a whole different experience.  And I don't get why some commenters here are saying that these do let some light through - I haven't had that issue at all.  And I didn't have to stack any dims to get the job done.

Also some have said that you have to be sure to apply the dims exactly over the light, as they are not removable to re-apply in the correct position.  I didn't experience that either.  I did use a tweezer to grasp a tiny edge of the dim to assist in placement, and this worked great.  And when I did apply it off-center, it was no trouble at all to remove and re-apply.  In one instance I applied a small circle, found it was slightly too small, and removed it and placed it back on the sheet for another time.  I can't think of a single thing I could possibly have against these dims.  There are more than enough on this 100-sticker sheet for my own use so I can share with a friend.  I will gladly recommend this amazing product to all.

2505,2701,2701,Great,"These dimmer stickers are SO helpful.  I got the full black out variety and they fully black out the annoying/intrusive light.  The video is of my alarm clock which has a blinking center colon to count off the seconds, and it drives me UP THE FREAKIN WALLLLL.  I’ve always had the clock face toward the room rather than me which means I either have to get uncomfortable again to look at the time, or check my phone which inevitably leads to me staring at the phone for too long.  Since the numbers and symbols are under the surface glass of the clock a bit it was a good example since you can still barely see the covered light from a steep angle and know how blacked out the lights are.  I’ve also used these on several pieces of tech at work - in fact before I knew these existed I took a hole punch to some electrical tape and made a “dimmer sticker” for my old office phone (if only I knew there was a business in that!!).  These are less tacky than tape so it seems like they won’t leave marks if you remove them which is great, and come in a variety of convenient sizes, such as the exact size of my monitor buttons at work.

I also think it’s great that this product was born in the US and I hope the creators will be able to bring the manufacturing home soon, or at least are making sure their Chinese factory is one of the ones that doesn’t use abusive labor!

There is no flex to these stickers and my monitor buttons are slightly indented, so I’m not sure if they’ll stay or fall off, but these last two points are really my only complaint.  I don’t love that everything besides the stickers is 100% plastic, but maybe it’s to protect the adhesive for transit and storage?

2512,2708,2708,Nice wallet alternative,"I like old fashioned trifold leather wallets that can hold unlimited amount of cards and photos in them but they get bulky. This is the tradeoff. I am so used to trifolds to slide bills in and this has a pseudo bi-fold from the viewpoint of putting bills in as it leaves the other third hanging out of the wallet but does fold in over itself.

I've looked at ridge wallets before but those just have a money clip to hold money, not smart to advertise you have cash and I'm not sure how secure cash in a clip is, but in full transparency, I haven't owned one either.

A couple annoyances for me on this wallet is that it has a pocket for an airtag that makes it wider. Cool it has this for those that want it but I solved this with a seam ripper, removing the pocket. It leaves some holes where it was sewn together though, but I use this for a reminder for my other annoyance...

So, the wallet has NFC blocking built into it, which is great to protecting against card scanning, but I like to have my employee badge in my wallet so when I need to open a secure door, I put my wallet on the sensor and I'm good. This wallet mostly blocks this. To get around this, I placed my badge in the middle fold, at the very back and press the wallet that used to have the airtag pocket against the door sensor plate. If I push the wallet against the sensor, it still catches, at least for most of the doors.

I chose this wallet as it had more space for cards than some of the other ridge-like wallets, and has a fold to place bills in, instead of a clip. It is smaller than my old trifold leather wallet and so I still had to reduce down what went in it... goodbye saver cards!

In the back pocket, it feels comfortable, even with hard plastic, because of the smaller size, fits better, whereas the leather would stick way out but bend however it needed to.",3,B0CLGXF95S,"I like old fashioned trifold leather wallets hold unlimited amount cards photos get bulky.

2599,2803,2803,This Victor trap works well for mice.,"After researching a lot of different mouse traps, we finally tried this electronic trap. I originally tried the Rinne Flip N Slide Bucket lid no-kill mouse traps where the mouse climbs on top of a 5 gallon bucket (not included) to reach a bait and falls through the trap floor which flips down into the bucket. There are a lot of knock offs out there that may work well, but I bought the original Rinne trap and it just didn't work for us. We had two set up in our basement where there was mouse activity and we did catch one mouse, but it escaped every time and that's because the trap floor, when closed, is not flush with the yellow lid and apparently the mouse can escape through small gaps. We put small pieces of almond in the back of the trap floor so the only way the mouse could reach it, was to walk back and the trap floor would flip down and the mouse would fall into the bucket. Twice the almonds were gone and we peeked in the bucket and saw mouse poop but no mouse.

So I gave in and looked for an electronic trap that would at least humanely kill the mouse quickly. This Victor trap is very easy to use and set up. You just put in four AA batteries (you could use rechargeable batteries but we used regular to try it out) in the top compartment which slides open. Then you put bait in the back of the unit. The instructions say to put peanut butter through the holes in the back of the unit. But the cleaning instructions say not to get the metal plates inside wet. I don't see how you can easily clean the unit without risking getting the plates wet. Especially when using peanut butter. Instead, we just put a small piece of cheese in the back. The power switch is on the top and after you turn it on, it will blink green a few times and then go dark and remain dark. When the trap catches a mouse, the green light will blink until you turn it off and remove the mouse. Note: When the trap has a mouse and blinks green, the green light blinks slowly, not nearly as fast as when you first turn it on. It's about 9 seconds between blinks. So if you're quickly checking on the trap from a distance, you should look at it for a while to see if it the green light blinks. Or, just go up to the trap and look inside because one end of the trap is completely open.

On the second night, we got a mouse. So it works and I'm ordering a second unit to put in another room in our basement.

Update: After setting up the second unit (both in the basement), we have caught a total of seven mice. So the traps are working consistently.",5,B0CQ8RTXRT,"After researching lot different mouse traps, finally tried electronic trap.

I’ve had a few wired and wireless headphones and this is still the best value. In-ear and earbuds tend to take away a lot of the outside sounds, so having a pair of earbuds can make you unaware of your surroundings, but these don’t go fully in your ear so you can hear what’s happening around you. A lot of people are so deep into their phones and their music or podcasts while walking, that they walk into walls, doors, water fountains, etc., get banged in crosswalks.

Instead of tracking down a handful of USB bricks around the house and cables in the morning before a trip, you chuck the little tech travel kit in your luggage and you don't have to worry about a thing!

So I bought this case for my mom to do this exact thing for Christmas. To my eyes, it looks smaller in the pictures than it did when loading it up. I also didn't realize it had two pockets. This is not exactly a problem for my mom that packs everything under the sun, but it's not as compact as I would've liked.

However, she'll leverage that extra space (and extra compartment) for *something*. And the aesthetic matches most of her luggage and travel bags, so it's a perfect match for her.

This works exactly as they describe, and it will keep kids out of your cabinets.

2693,2905,2905,May be the best conference camera I have seen.,"I have seen some other products from the same company, this may be the top of their line. This conference webcam stands about 12 inches tall and contains a speaker in its base. On top are 4 touch buttons to control volume, microphone mute and an AI video function.

I plugged it into a Windows 11 laptop and it was immediately recognized as a camera and speaker. I was able to pull up a zoom window and select this. Under the camera options it offers a resolution up to 2560 by 1440. You can also do 1920x1080 at 60 frames per second. I noticed almost immediately that there was a face recognition box it appeared on my screen. The webcam contains the smarts to recognize in in some cases zoom in on your face. If other people join the conference it will zoom back out to include them. Initially I was concerned about the 120 degree field of view, but the zoom function allows you to narrow that quite a bit.

I want to pay special attention to the remote control.  This webcam can be set on a conference table but it can also be mounted to a tripod separately. It operates off of a 10 foot long usb-c cable which plugs into the base.  One thing I have hated is cans that have a hardwired short cable that forces you to be within a certain distance. Since this cable is detachable you can substitute anything. Able to get 10 feet away allows amazing flexibility. If I need to do a presentation at a white board that is easy to manage.

My laptop provided enough current to run it directly but if you need to there is also an AC power cube with a 6 foot cable that can power it independently. Because you can set this cam far away from where you are, there is an IR remote control that allows you to shut off the video, mute the audio, adjust the primary center of the image using a control pad, pull up a menu of other options or toggle zoom options. One nice feature is one button auto zoom.  Another button opens an onscreen menu for exposure correction and options.

The audio from the speakers is great. The noise cancelation seems to be good as well. I have not had any feedback issues. It's been able to pick up my voice from at least 10 feet away and maintain good audio for my listeners. The video quality and auto exposure seems to work very well from brightly lit to normal room lighting .  I'm still experimenting with the AI face tracking.

2697,2909,2909,Cheap webcam dressed as an expensive one,"This webcam is fine and does everything it claims but doesn’t have any notable features that you wouldn’t get on a quality webcam at half the price.

The picture quality of the camera and optics are average, it does digital zoom but doesn’t have any sort of optical zoom so I wouldn’t use it in a conference room where you’d be far from the camera.  Sure it has auto framing, but so do most 100 dollar video conferencing cameras.

I suppose having the speaker and mic integrated into the unit is good, but again a good mic is integrated into most webcams so what are we gaining here, a speaker?  If it was an exceptional quality speaker or mic then I could possibly justify the price but no such luck.  Cheap tinny speaker and electret mic.

It would be well worth the price if it had its own network connection and you could use it to video conference without an attached computer.  Then you could truly use it as a video conferencing appliance in a conference room…. But you cant.

The only use case I can think of for this thing is if you have a large wall mounted monitor and the top mount format or the looks of most consumer webcams will clash with your decor.

Setting it up was a piece of cake. I just plugged it into my computer, and I was good to go. It feels really sturdy and well-made, so I know it'll last.

The buttons on it are simple to use. You can adjust the volume and turn it on or off easily. It even has cool colored lights on the bottom that you can change to match your style or link it to other Logitech color schemes w/ the LG Hub Software.

2785,3004,3004,Useless,"I purchased a 20-Pack of GearIT Cat5e Ethernet Patch Cables (3 feet) with high hopes, but unfortunately, I've been disappointed with my purchase. First and foremost, the build quality of these cables is subpar. The connectors feel flimsy, and I've had several of them break or come loose after just a short period of use. This has led to unreliable connections and frustrating troubleshooting.

Another issue I've encountered is that the cables seem to have inconsistent performance. Some of them work fine, but others have slow data transfer speeds or even drop the connection altogether. It's frustrating to have to test each cable individually to find ones that actually perform as expected.

Additionally, the cables are quite stiff and not very flexible, which makes routing and managing them a hassle. They also tend to tangle easily, adding to the frustration.

Overall, I cannot recommend the GearIT 20-Pack of Cat5e Ethernet Patch Cables. The poor build quality, inconsistent performance, and lack of flexibility make them a less than ideal choice for anyone looking for reliable and durable Ethernet cables.

I purchased a few &#34;20 packs&#34; of these cables and they seem to have sent two different brands with slightly different shades of blue. The darker blue that they sent me had a VERY tough boot to the point where I needed to jam a screw driver up inside the boot to be able to disconnect it. All in all I think the quality I received was fair for the price. If I had to do it all over again I would probably try to find cables without boots.

2808,3040,3040,"These are IT, THE rechargeable lithium AA batteries","I've tried rechargeable lithium AA/AAA batteries from EBL, Hixon, Deleepow, Soshine, and XTAR. While the XTARs were the best experience out of those, all of them fell short in key ways. They all self-discharged rapidly. Their capacity claims are purportedly for the lithium cell inside, not the power you can expect to be delivered to the device after conversion. So rather than claim the companies are lying about the internal cell I'll just say that their designs are terribly inefficient at stepping down the 3.7v of the internal lithium cell, with the exception of XTAR which was just mildly inefficient. The biggest issue being a significantly cheaper Ni-MH cell will outperform every one of these batteries in runtime (the XTAR being the best performer had less runtime than a standard Eneloop in an LED flashlight), the only situation where these lithium cells make sense is where having a constant 1.5v is critical to the devices operation, but this also makes it impossible to know how much power is remaining in the batteries as you use them. The XTARs (newest model as of this review) have a feature that drops the voltage to 1.2v as the internal cell battery voltage runs low, but this is so close to empty that it might as well be empty in any high-drain application where these batteries would be an appropriate choice over Ni-MH.

These Coast batteries are a huge leap in the right direction. Using my SkyRC NC2200 I am getting between 2600-2800mah when discharging at 500mah, more power than is stated by the manufacturer. They also seemed to artificially lower their voltage on a curve as the battery discharges. My Garmin eTrex SE has a feature to tune the battery gauge to specific battery chemistries, and to my surprise the only accurate setting was the one for Alkaline.

The built-in charging is important for my use as well. I plan on using these for multi-day camping / backpacking trips. I only want to carry one battery bank and one type of cable for the trip and charge all my devices that way to minimize items and weight. With these batteries my handheld GPS and headlamp can last multiple days use, I can tell when they need to be charged, and if they need to be charged I can do so without an extra charger or cable in my bag.

There are a couple of cons. The biggest is the price. $10 per cell is kind of insane, but just try and find another rechargeable lithium AA that compares right now. Another con is weight. These weigh considerably more than disposable lithium cells which are also more energy dense. For backpacking, it would be seriously worth the effort to understand how long your AA devices last and if you should just go disposable and bring a couple extra disposables. Another con is that these cells are now only on-par with some of the high capacity Ni-MH batteries which are considerably cheaper.",4,B0CFSHV5WN,"I've tried rechargeable lithium AA/AAA batteries EBL, Hixon, Deleepow, Soshine, XTAR.

2818,3050,3050,May be the best conference camera I have seen.,"I have seen some other products from the same company, this may be the top of their line. This conference webcam stands about 12 inches tall and contains a speaker in its base. On top are 4 touch buttons to control volume, microphone mute and an AI video function.

I plugged it into a Windows 11 laptop and it was immediately recognized as a camera and speaker. I was able to pull up a zoom window and select this. Under the camera options it offers a resolution up to 2560 by 1440. You can also do 1920x1080 at 60 frames per second. I noticed almost immediately that there was a face recognition box it appeared on my screen. The webcam contains the smarts to recognize in in some cases zoom in on your face. If other people join the conference it will zoom back out to include them. Initially I was concerned about the 120 degree field of view, but the zoom function allows you to narrow that quite a bit.

I want to pay special attention to the remote control.  This webcam can be set on a conference table but it can also be mounted to a tripod separately. It operates off of a 10 foot long usb-c cable which plugs into the base.  One thing I have hated is cans that have a hardwired short cable that forces you to be within a certain distance. Since this cable is detachable you can substitute anything. Able to get 10 feet away allows amazing flexibility. If I need to do a presentation at a white board that is easy to manage.

My laptop provided enough current to run it directly but if you need to there is also an AC power cube with a 6 foot cable that can power it independently. Because you can set this cam far away from where you are, there is an IR remote control that allows you to shut off the video, mute the audio, adjust the primary center of the image using a control pad, pull up a menu of other options or toggle zoom options. One nice feature is one button auto zoom.  Another button opens an onscreen menu for exposure correction and options.

The audio from the speakers is great. The noise cancelation seems to be good as well. I have not had any feedback issues. It's been able to pick up my voice from at least 10 feet away and maintain good audio for my listeners. The video quality and auto exposure seems to work very well from brightly lit to normal room lighting .  I'm still experimenting with the AI face tracking.

Used it for a few group meetings and worked great. Everyone was seen and heard and it couldn't have gone better. Picture was clear and mics picked us all up clearly too. It was a big empty room where everyone was at least 10 feet away from the device. Impressive.

2821,3053,3053,All-in-one webcam,"First and foremost, I want to mention that I've had the opportunity to use both versions of this camera: the one with higher resolution and its lower resolution counterpart, and I must say, they are both exceptional. Personally, I'm a big fan of the auto-framing feature and the microphone quality, especially since it doesn't have that annoying ""mic boom"" that I've encountered with some other webcam setups. The included remote control also functions smoothly for mode changes and focusing.

However, there's one minor issue I've encountered with both versions. After about 30 instances of my PC going to sleep and waking up, the camera stops being recognized by Windows.

Overall, what sets this camera apart is that it operates without the need for drivers, and it boasts excellent microphone and camera quality, along with a reasonable speaker. In fact, over the past few months, I've had numerous calls where I didn't feel the necessity to use headphones or connect an external microphone. For me, that's a significant advantage, and it's the reason why I continue to use this camera to this day.",5,B0C5C2NJW3,"First foremost, I want mention I've opportunity use versions camera: one higher resolution lower resolution counterpart, I must say, exceptional.

2822,3054,3054,Cheap webcam dressed as an expensive one,"This webcam is fine and does everything it claims but doesn’t have any notable features that you wouldn’t get on a quality webcam at half the price.

The picture quality of the camera and optics are average, it does digital zoom but doesn’t have any sort of optical zoom so I wouldn’t use it in a conference room where you’d be far from the camera.  Sure it has auto framing, but so do most 100 dollar video conferencing cameras.

I suppose having the speaker and mic integrated into the unit is good, but again a good mic is integrated into most webcams so what are we gaining here, a speaker?  If it was an exceptional quality speaker or mic then I could possibly justify the price but no such luck.  Cheap tinny speaker and electret mic.

It would be well worth the price if it had its own network connection and you could use it to video conference without an attached computer.  Then you could truly use it as a video conferencing appliance in a conference room…. But you cant.

The only use case I can think of for this thing is if you have a large wall mounted monitor and the top mount format or the looks of most consumer webcams will clash with your decor.

My experience with batteries is that as long as you get alkaline batteries, and not heavy-duty batteries, the life of the battery is pretty similar between generic and name brand batteries.

After my store experience, I knew generic batteries was the best path for me. When I saw the Ever-Brite alkaline 64 pack for the same price as a 24 pack of name brand batteries I pounced. As my picture indicates, the batteries came in nice storage case. This is appreciated, because loose batteries tend to wind up hither and yon in a container.

2876,3115,3115,This is the cable that Iron Man would probably use,"I bought this cable to use indoors.  I run it from the router in the living room back to my bedroom.  Honestly we step all over our ethernet cables because I've been too lazy to buy or build a cable guard to run them up under.  This cable has the most sturdy build quality of any ethernet cable I have owned.  You can see and feel the quality build.  It's not one of those lousy generic cables that you can squeeze and feel the individual wires inside of them.

This has worked perfectly without fail or loss of performance.  The cables looks as good as new, despite some concessional dirt and I believe i will last a very long time.  I was replacing the dirt cheap ones almost on a 12-16 month basis.

I promise I'll get on that cable guard eventually!
